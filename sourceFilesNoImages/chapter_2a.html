  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all,<br>
I wanted to make a quick note about Skylab's end of life. So, at the time of deorbit, the things left on station would be the adapter module, the orbital workshop, and the mounting bracket for the solar array wing that was pictured. Massive solar arrays are a huge asset, especially in early station building, so those would have been recovered and returned to Earth on the final shuttle flight to the station, most likely on STS-10. Shuttle-Skylab, while seemingly a good early idea for the Shuttle program, likely would have been fraught with issues that would plague any crew visiting. The first thing to note is the incompatible atmosphere, and would require the use of an adapter module to make the transition from Shuttle's atmosphere to Skylab's. The second issue would be the <i>trash</i>. Skylab was FILTHY. Unlike modern facilities like the International Space Station and China's Space Station, there were no resupply ships that dispose of unwanted materials (Such as Cygnus, Progress, Tianzhou etc). This lead to a lot of junk just hanging out, likely getting in the way of the crew. There are a whole host of engineering concerns for Skylab as well, such as thermal management, power generation, and an aging life support system that would most certainly cause headaches.<br>

Hi everyone! I know many people have been very curious about the orbiter arrangement thus far, and I <i>promise</i> all will be revealed regarding OV-102 next week. This week, we're gonna start taking a look at some proposals, and pushing higher, further, and faster than ever before. I wanna thank <a href="https://twitter.com/undeadfake" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Max</a> for all their hard work on this post, they did a super job with this concept art I'm about to show you, and I'm so grateful!<br>
<br>
Anyway, on with the show!
