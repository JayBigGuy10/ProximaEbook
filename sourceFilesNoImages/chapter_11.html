  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">F</span><span class="calibre6">or many, the wake of <i>Valiant’s</i> disaster was the hardest part. Rockwell, Martin Marietta, NASA and the Air Force had answered tough questions not only from Congress, but from the public about the state of the civilian shuttle fleet. Many thought it would only be a matter of time before the pursuit of a dream like humans on Mars would kill more astronauts, and called for funding to be cut. Cooler heads would ultimately prevail, and funding for Olympus would remain on track. To those within NASA, it was an indirect day of reckoning, for they were dealing with the fallout of the Air Force’s mistake in such a public manner. The images of the USAF orbiter's debris falling to the sea haunted those at Rockwell and NASA. The stand down period, for many within the Olympus partner agencies, was the most tense silence. Could it mean the end of the program? <i>Challenger’s</i> return to flight the previous year had certainly cut the tension, but those within the agency knew that they had to make sure that Olympus remained safely on schedule. The Air Force would march on, seemingly unfazed, but had quietly shelved plans for human spaceflight, such as the ODIN project. The station hardware, roughly 70% completed, would sit in the processing buildings at Vandenberg for the foreseeable future. However, work was already underway on a new program, one in which autonomous, quickly recoverable spacecraft could do the job of Valiant without the risk, and feelers were being sent out to contractors who would be willing to build it. Boeing soon expressed interest in working with the Department of Defense, and a concept known only as the Transatmospheric Vehicle would soon become the focus of the USAF.<br>

1988 began the next wave of Martian autonomous exploration, in the form of new orbiters, rover and stationary lander. Launching on the latest version of Titan, Titan IV, the <i>Mars Reconnaissance Imager</i> would more accurately identify landing sites, and many within JPL and Johnson viewed the MRI as the final autonomous element before the program could proceed with moving towards the crew mission. Titan IV would find itself acting as somewhat of a workhorse vehicle, combined with the new Delta 6000 series of vehicles. Delta 6000 made its debut to Mars launching the <i>Mars Polar Ice Lander</i>, a small lander designed to explore the polar regions of Mars and look for water ice, as well as deploy a small, six wheeled roving vehicle - the first of its kind on Mars. This rover, named<i> Earhart</i>, designed for 20 sols of operation on the Martian surface, far exceeded its design life, and covered a distance of 2.3 km before its solar cells degraded too far to generate usable power. Another probe to join the armada was <i>Shinpi</i>, a Japanese weather probe delayed from the 1986 window. Issues with the N-II rocket intended to launch it had resulted in NASDA missing the window, and the vehicle was ultimately moved to the upgraded H-I vehicle in its stead. The probe would make the trek to Mars, and would capture new and exciting images of Mars’ moon, Phobos.</span></p>

Shuttle and Soyuz continued to resupply Odyssey, rotating crews out as they prepared the station for upcoming strenuous spacewalks to support MTV construction. NASA had been cautious in their return of Shuttle operations, and put all manifested shuttle pilots through an intense retraining about abort procedures. While NASA never flew the orbiter with the Aft Cargo Carrier, they remained wary of the RTLS, much as the early shuttle crews had been. The modified, APAS equipped Soyuz, turns out to be something of a godsend, allowing crews easy rotation while still providing an orbital lifeboat for the station’s occupants in anticipation of Liberté. Shuttle crews debuted the new Multi Purpose Logistics Module, a temporary module designed to be brought up with and returned on the shuttle, enabling large amounts of cargo and transferring them through an Common Berthing Mechanism hatch. Shuttle flew with the MPLM 4 times during 1988, preparing the station for the upcoming flurry of activity in support of MTV construction. Meanwhile, not far away from the Odyssey complex, <i>Zarya</i> saw its first visit by space shuttle Intrepid, bringing with it the <i>Pirs</i> Shuttle-Station docking adapter. <i>Pirs</i> was first removed from the shuttle cargo bay and installed on the docking port, and docked to the passive port on <i>Spektr</i>. This adapter, with a Soviet probe and drogue port on one end, and a NASA-standard APAS port on the other, aimed to enable rotation flights via the Shuttle to <i>Zarya</i>, which served two distinct goals. The first goal was additional training on Russian systems, which US and Partner agencies wanted in order to ease technical challenges with the upcoming Mars missions, and the second was to increase in-space time with crews from both sides of the Iron Curtain. The Shuttle docked with <i>Zarya</i> twice over the course of two back to back missions, and a unique capability was demonstrated in which the two stations were brought close together to demonstrate proximity operations of large structures, something required for operations of the upcoming MTV. A second test of this system was carried out with Space Shuttle <i>Atlantis</i> positioned below the two structures, simulating a Shuttle’s rendezvous and proximity operations with an MTV.</span></p>

Since the issues that had cropped up with NERVA-NeXT began, it was clear that the engine originally chosen to power the MTV would not be sufficient for the needs of the program. A quiet second genesis had happened in response, a commercial birth of a nuclear engine. Project V had evolved into Valkyrie, a newly designed pebble bed reactor engine built by Lockheed in collaboration with Naval Reactors, and had seen considerable improvements on the teststand over General Atomics’ design. It was on this assessment to move forward with Valkyrie as the engine for Olympus, casting NERVA-NeXT by the wayside. For NASA and their partners, it was an easy deal. The engine could be ready sooner, would be cheaper to build, and had a greater service life than what was projected for NERVA. The first prototype flights of Valkyrie, launched by a Titan IV, would send a converted Centaur stage on a free return, high energy trajectory around the Moon. Named <i>Way-Seeker</i>, the mission would aim to demonstrate the multiple aspects of a typical MTV sortie. The first task at hand would be starting the thing, something never before tried in space. After the reactor was powered up, and prop settled, the first short burn demonstrated the nuclear engine’s performance for engineers on earth. Following this short burn, a much longer burn was initiated to send the demonstrator on a trajectory around the moon not unlike Apollo 8. In the days after LEO departure, engineers monitored the stability of the reactor, thermal loading and general health of the vehicle. <i>Way-Seeker</i>, having completed its lunar flyby, returned to swing by Earth and demonstrated the braking maneuver the MTV crew would execute on the return trip, as well as fine orbital adjustment with the nuclear engine. The burns were successful, and the stage demonstrated a second long loiter time restart. Having successfully inserted <i>Way-Seeker</i> into a disposal orbit, mission control commanded the depletion of the onboard propellant, and shut down the reactor; appeasing those who would worry about a nuclear propulsion system simply hanging out in space. The mission was a rousing success, and full scale production of Valkyrie engines could begin for the MTVs. To those at General Atomics, it was an embarrassment of orbital proportions. Their own engine, the supposed pride and joy of what was to be a fleet of deep space exploration vehicles, was confined to fate as a boondoggle.</span></p>

With their success in orbit, NASA, the USSR and the international partners began to select crew members for the “Mars Cadre”: a group of astronauts to be selected for flights in the Olympus program. These astronauts were trained in the Nevada desert in the Long Duration Mars Simulation Facility, designed to emulate Martian conditions. These astronauts would consist of both rookies and veterans, with the aim being to train in an environment that would resemble their initial sorties as closely as possible. The 30-40 day stays to be conducted during the first wave, Block 1, missions would see a crew of four living out of their lander, while a team remained in orbit to provide real time communications through the relay network already at Mars. To simulate the split crew operations, the lander’s cabin was replicated, and about 45 miles away, a reconstruction of the MTV’s habitable volume was constructed, and observations made on the operating procedure would inform behaviors of both mission control, and the two teams on the early Olympus Missions. This type of training soon was mandated as the standard procedure for training Olympus astronauts, and new astronaut candidates would be put through analog training for Mars as well as operations on Odyssey.<br>
<br>
It was only after the engine selection went well where NASA felt the mission manifest for the first flights could be laid out. Olympus 1 would consist of a fully crewed Medium to High Earth Orbit flight with a duration of 4 months, simulating both departure and retrieval by Shuttle. Olympus 2 would be a month-long Low Earth Orbit test in conjunction with the prototype MSAV, and would consist of docking tests and autonomous operation of both the MTV and the lander. Olympus S1, while not technically manifested as a full fledged Olympus mission, would slot itself into the support role, sending the Mars Base Station, nicknamed Basecamp, onward to the Red Planet after it had been fueled in LEO. This would demonstrate not only orbital fueling of the MTV-derived Transfer Element, but evaluate performance of the Valkyrie nuclear engine in deep space operations. Olympus S2 would be the next to fly, sending a prepositioned cargo lander to the selected landing site of the upcoming mission using a commercial launch vehicle. Olympus 3 would see a fully crewed flight of the MTV, as well as a Transfer Element on Olympus S3 carrying the fully operational MSAV lander. There, they would rendezvous with the Mars Base Station and perform their sortie at Elysium Planitia, spend time in Martian orbit, then return home. Human eyes were set on Mars, and the roadmap was finally clear.   <br>

In the Space Station Processing Facility, the inflatable Habitat Module and Nodal Utility Module for MTV-1 were being looked over in preparation for their launch to Odyssey. These modules had undergone extensive testing in conjunction with their manufacturers, Lockheed, Thales and Boeing, and were at last ready to make their debut in space. The first launch of the program would be the Nodal Utility Module, forming the backbone of construction and the point at which the MTV would expand from. This module would house several key components for the ship as a whole, including the primary life support rack, radiation shelter, airlock and communications station.  While the node was being readied to be integrated to Space Shuttle <i>Discovery</i>, delays with both the SDLV required to launch the inflatable habitation node and the Liberté crew rescue vehicle would require the high bays and pads to be prepped for other missions. These included <i>Terra</i>, a heavy Earth observing climate satellite launched to geostationary orbit onboard <i>Challenger</i>, and <i>FAR</i>, the Ferrous Asteroid Recon mission to the rocky bodies between Mars and Jupiter onboard <i>Atlantis</i>. The node, and <i>Discovery</i> would remain on the ground, but not before the press would catch sight of the name of the first MTV under construction as it was rolled into the OPF: <i>Minerva</i></span></p>
