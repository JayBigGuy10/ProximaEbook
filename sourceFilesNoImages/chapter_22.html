  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">I</span><span class="calibre6">n the early spring of 1998, space shuttle <i>Discovery</i> leapt off the pad at Kennedy Space Center, carrying with it the latest piece of space hardware for Odyssey, the <i>Copernicus</i> laboratory. Based on the design of the highly successful Multi Purpose Logistics Module, <i>Copernicus</i> would incorporate an external science platform and a new, smaller robotic arm to support external science experiments. It was an exciting time, Odyssey had begun its stand down from its operations as a shipyard and shifted its focus on long duration science, something the Olympus crews and life on Earth benefitted from greatly. The station had also recently received upgrades to their power facilities; a third solar array wing had been delivered to help augment the growing need for power when assembling spacecraft on and around the facility. <i>Discovery</i> would catch up with Odyssey after a several day chase, and the two great vehicles would become one, with the crew of Odyssey greeting the six Shuttle crew members, forming a cohesive unit of 12 in orbit. The work could begin on extracting <i>Copernicus</i> from the payload bay of the shuttle, the delicate handling manipulators working together to place the module on its CBM on station. The module, built by Thales Alenia space, was covered in external mounting points, designed to maximize potential science looking at both the Earth and space. Several experiments were already planned to make use of this space, through both government enterprise and private experiments. <i>Copernicus</i> would also contain the dedicated sleep station for European astronauts, who were eager to try new ideas and test new solutions for long term human residence in space. The station was in a strange era, transitioning between orbital birthplace and established science and research station. The work done at Odyssey, on the part of aggregation, had been fairly successful, but a problem had plagued the platform’s existence since its inception was crew and vehicle scheduling. The station partners were eager to keep the crew working on valuable science, and so, an idea had been floated. What if there was another station, one to remain at the ready to help assemble spacecraft, and distribute launches? The Odyssey Removable Cargo Shelter had been shown to work well, and could easily be fitted on this new platform. Early designs soon turned to work done by the Air Force on their short lived ODIN station, and prepared to extend olive branches in regards to collaboration with the Department of Defense. This new station would orbit in a lower inclination than the Grand Complexes already in orbit, more suited for missions outside of the Earth’s sphere of influence, and could potentially help expand Olympus missions as they prepared for longer stays on the surface. In a sense, this platform would become a gateway to other worlds, a stepping stone by which humanity could further explore the cosmos.</span></p>

  <i>Discovery hangs below Odyssey, having grown in the approach to the new millennium. Copernicus' external rack was installed during the STS-121 mission. Now, the station was ready for even more science. New solar arrays would assist the station in enabling greater science return from the facility, and open the door for expansion.</i>

Shuttle flights would pick up in cadence once again as the fleet of ships in LEO were being prepared for their next great endeavor. <i>Prometheus</i>, dormant since her mission on Olympus 2, had been reactivated in preparation for the crew of Olympus 4 to arrive. The crew of Olympus 4, led by NASA veteran Mark Teller, would be another international display of unity, with Russian MTV pilot Dmitri Kovalev, mission surgeon Dr. Astrid Deinau of France, German mission specialist Mikkel Van Helt, Russian lander pilot Anastasiya Federova, Japanese mission specialist Takeshi Takeda, American Dr. Gabriel Herald, and orbital communications specialist Mitchell Coleman of Australia. <i>Intrepid</i> would lift off from Pad 39A after the Jupiter-OPAV fleet had finished their job of fueling both the MTV, and their lander, <i>Corvus</i>. The two vehicles hung in orbit, their crew only growing more excited as they approached the great spacecraft. They hung, ever so delicately, in the muddled blackness of Low Earth Orbit, awaiting the orbiter’s approach and embrace. The first few hours of flight had been rather uneventful, but this mundane nature was soon shattered as Dr. Herald had grown ill adjusting to orbit, suffering from a short but violent bout of Space Adaptation Syndrome. The crew would find themselves scrambling to help him adjust, and to ensure that any uncontained fluids did not interfere with the vehicle. The docking with <i>Prometheus</i> would be slow and steady, and the myriad of electronic eyes onboard the MTV would work to scan the incoming ship, measure its approach rate, and adjust accordingly. The spacecraft and shuttle would become one, with their docking mechanisms gently bringing the two great spacecraft together. Operations in orbit would last for about 8 days, as the crew of Intrepid assisted the Olympus 4 crew in moving cargo onto their MTV, ready to make humanity’s next foray into the unknown. It seemed almost routine now, to have <i>Intrepid</i> carry crews to their great ships, ready to cast off into the unknown, but it was an exciting time nonetheless. This crew would not fly with a journalist, like they had on Olympus 3, but the lessons learned from years of carrying cameras to space allowed the support crew to do their best at homemade documentary making. It was, as the support crew on Olympus 3 had called it, a truly humbling and sobering time. These days were full of joy, and anticipation. On July 21st, the orbiter would return home to Kennedy Space Center, her mission complete, and 5 days later, the movement of hundreds of tons of spacecraft could begin. <i>Corvus</i> would ignite the nuclear engines on her transfer element first, sending the vehicle on a trajectory out of the Earth-Moon system, and towards the Red Planet. Several hours later, <i>Prometheus</i> would light her engines, and cast the crew into the abyss, on a journey once again for the benefit of all humankind. The burn would take them across the dark side of the planet, city lights and vast expanses of darkness would meet the crew as their nuclear engines pushed them faster and faster still, their velocity vector moving further from the surface of their home planet. On the ground, the nuclear engines put on the light show, the vaguely red tinted exhaust emanating from a small point of light. Soon, the acceleration would cease, and the G indicator in the cabin would bump lazily against the flight deck instrumentation panel. They were at last free of the pull of their homeworld, racing through the Van Allen belts and further and further into the unknown. The crew would communicate with Earth as long as they could normally, and enjoy the view as their homeworld slipped away, so delicate in its orbit, hanging silently as the crew settled in for the long journey ahead of them.</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">At nearly the same instant, around the Red Planet, the crew of Olympus 3 was making their final preparations to return home. The last several days in orbit were spent preparing the Base Station for the long hibernation before she would see a crew again, and checking the health of the orbiters circling the planet, ensuring that the next crew would be met with greater success in their capture burn, and taking in the sweeping vistas of the planet below them. The samples from the planet, weighing in at 42 pounds, would be loaded into a secure container onboard <i>Minerva</i>, to be opened when the crew would return to Earth. It was, in many ways, a solemn moment, as they pondered their work done on the planet’s surface and in its orbit. It was theirs, for now, their world that they had explored in such intimate detail. Soon, it would be open for even more discovery, the planet still had secrets to give after all. The hatches between <i>Minerva</i> and the Base Station would be sealed on August 2nd, 1998, and the crew would don their flight suits, ready to face the coming voyage. At 12:50 PM, local time, the two great crafts would separate, not for the last time, but for now as the first human mission to the Red Planet would head for home. The crew would begin to secure the cabin as they drifted away from their home away from home, the station becoming a distant point of light on their monitors and windows. Soon, the time would come to strap in once more, ready to bear the brunt of acceleration as the nuclear engines pushed them towards home. The keys of the igniter panel, in storage for so many months, could now be pressed into the console once more, and turned in unison, as the crew exhaled gently to prepare themselves for the force of the engines coming to life. The reactors would come online, and the engines sparked to life, spitting fire and fury as the crew sank into their seats. Once again, the steady tick of the geiger counter brought comfort to the crew as they pushed ever further from the red rock they had called home. Racing behind the planet, the burn continued, pushing them further and further out of the sphere of influence. The planet which held them was no longer, and the vastness of space could once again fill their windows, empty until the crescent limb of Earth would be visible once more. Commander Douglass would take the time to reflect with her crew, and reflect on the time they had spent in orbit around the planet. She would make note of the challenges still to come, and the hopes and dreams of those left on the planet, remarking; "my fears of a woman changed for something sinister have not been realized, rather, I am met with the reflection of a woman no longer bound to Earth, no longer bound by terrestrial gravity, but only limited by the mind. Whoever comes next, whoever will set their feet on Mars, will return changed - and I believe it is for the betterment of all mankind."</span></p>

The first month of their journey was filled with much needed rest, and the crew would take this time to once again hone their skills at Dude Darts, make art, and write. Shoemaker, the resident painter, would use a small paintbrush set and depict the crew on the surface, walking in space, and together with their loved ones on Earth, a hopeful vision of what was to come. Several anthropologists on Earth had been interested in not just the material study of the crews, but of their produced work. Maksimov had written a good deal of poetry during his surface sortie, and eagerly entered it into the folder meant for the anthropologists on Earth. The majority of the cruise would also be dedicated to a new field of study for in space crews, psychological study. While their training had certainly hardened them mentally, there were of course variances that the mission planners could not account for. A set of repeated experiments, conducted in its first phase during training, and later on the outbound cruise, would be performed once again on the crews to assess their mental state. One key area of note was downtime - it had a huge impact in enabling the crews to rest between strenuous tasks and enjoy privacy. However, it was noted that communal activities, such as mealtimes and work on the ship itself were something the crew all looked forward to. It showcased the bond between crewmembers, and the need for the future of spaceflight to be cooperative and international. In the face of growing space powers, those in government would soon take the lessons learned to begin to extend feelers into new areas, hoping to invite collaboration and cooperation with new agencies, and bring the world onboard with Olympus.<br>
<br>
At NASA headquarters, an urgent meeting between mission planners and industry professionals would take place. Olympus Planning Office personnel had identified a rare window to perform something that no one had done before, journey to a second planet, Venus. It was a difficult ask, with a good deal of potential risk, but the mission planners within the Olympus partners had been eager to test the MTV’s capabilities in ways not yet seen before. The goal was simple: send a reduced crew to Venus to observe the planet in orbit, and deploy a multitude of probes and landers, as demonstrated on Olympus 3 during their stay at Mars. This would take advantage of a unique modularity aspect for the MTV itself, the ability to stack four drop tanks instead of only two, which would have the delta-v requirements to push the whole stack to Venus in a 150 day transfer, with a 30 day stay in Low Venus Orbit, before a 280 day transfer back to Earth. It would however, require a doubling of the fueling operations done for a mission, and could potentially push the entire fueling system to its limit - but the mission designers felt it prudent to test the system to its absolute limit. <i>Hera</i>, having no flight time under her belt as of then, had been selected for this conversion, and moved into a lower orbit to prepare for assembly. It would require two additional drop tanks to be pulled from the production line, and readied in advance, additional Jupiter-OPAV flights, and the rapid training of a crew for a mission not originally envisioned for the program, but it could be done, and it was well within the interest of those in the Olympus partners to expand humanity’s reach even further.<br>
<br>
Work on <i>Hera’s</i> conversion began almost immediately, as she was brought back near Odyssey one more time to begin the arduous process of outfitting her. While the ability to stack 4 tanks at Odyssey was technically possible, current module arrangement and the work to upgrade the space station’s power equipment would result in the MTV being refit in proximity, rather than on the station itself. The first flight of this outfitting campaign would see <i>Endeavour</i> depart from LC-39B, carrying with it a Spacelab pallet and a crew of 6. This crew, STS-RF1, would oversee installation of new radiation shielding and flight control hardware, as well as better thermal management systems to enable operations closer to the sun. The modifications would prove difficult, as the crew had to call off several objectives due to fatigue, and falling behind schedule due to issues with suits. It was an unfortunate start to the modification program. One key objective that was met was the unlocking of the docking mechanism on the tank’s belly and dorsal sides. It was a complex EVA, and very finicky on a good day. The crew was able to ensure that the brackets were open and ready to accept the tanks, due to fly on the next set of Jupiter-OPAV flights. OV-201, <i>Adventure</i>, would take to the skies, powering the empty MTV tank to orbit. Her job completed, the fleet leader would make the return to Earth, coming to a stop at last in the desert. This tank, originally meant for <i>Minerva</i> upon her return and refit, would come to rest at the nadir side of the vehicle, awaiting its twin. OV-204, <i>Endurance</i>, would roll to the pad soon after, and ride out a small tropical depression as she waited to bring the great structure into orbit. The OPAV pod would eventually need to be rolled back for protection as the storm intensified to a small hurricane, and would shelter in the cavernous safety of the VAB.  <i>Endurance</i> would eventually pierce the skies, and bring with it the next piece required to bring humans to their long corrupted neighbor. </span></p>
