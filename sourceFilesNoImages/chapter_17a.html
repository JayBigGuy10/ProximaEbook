  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all!, I hope you all enjoyed our test flight of the Base Station and MTV systems, and look forward to the upcoming excitement. I wanted to highlight some more images from <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> today of the joint operations during Olympus 2, and share some thoughts about why I developed this architecture this way. When I first started development of the architecture, I noted a lack of contingency aborts in several mission architectures, such as the very rough Constellation system. As I researched, I found that the architecture of the Lockheed Martin Basecamp could be expanded upon, with your arrival station almost acting as a functional backup if something were to go wrong with your MTV.  The Basecamp architecture also enables long loiter times in the planet's orbit, which allows for more time to correctly identify a landing site, operate telerobotic missions if needed, and plan your sortie to the surface with the upmost accuracy. Thus, I arrived at the Olympus Architecture: A destination and aggregation point, while still allowing for a functional backup if need be. I also want to apologize for no images of the MSAV, except for the depiction in the mission patch: she is a bit of a beast and I want to make sure that I can get the details absolutely perfect before I show it to you all.<br>
<br>
With all that being said, let's take a look at some of the phenomenal images that Jay has put together for us!</span></p>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Good morning everyone!, It's a very very exciting time in the Proxima universe, as so many wonderful things are happening and we're really gearing up for the next giant leap. Many of the pieces required to get us to Mars are falling into place, and we're getting ever closer to humans seeing Mars with their own eyes up close. Today, we have two of our iconic artists on our post, <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PZerg5" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Zarbon</a>, as well as a new entry, <a href="https://twitter.com/salyutseven" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ben</a>! All three of them have been so kind as to lend their time to developing these amazing shots for us, and I cannot thank them enough. Anyway, let's get on with the show!</span></p>
