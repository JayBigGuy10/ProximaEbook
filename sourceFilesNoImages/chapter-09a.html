  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all, so today we are gonna look at some work that's very near and dear to my heart - maps! I wanted to illustrate the regions on Mars that the fleet identified, and that we'll be considering for our human landing program. Maps are what I work on in my free time, and Martian MOLA data (from which this is pulled) is one of the first sets of data that I trained on in my undergrad career. Anyway, I hope you enjoy! I will be posting a probes image annex later this week, and I cannot wait to show you all what we have in store!<br>

<b>Chapter 9.5: Image Annex</b><br>
<br>
Scientists on Earth, in the first several months of operations at Mars, would receive a bounty of data unlike anything they had ever encountered. The seemingly dead world was a dynamic place, full of potential water ice, interesting surface geology, trace gases and vistas that were longing to be taken in by crews on the surface. Data from <i>Eros</i> and <i>Anteros</i> had been some of the most advantageous, combining their camera lenses with powerful altitude sensors to produce incredible images. In their course of study, the scientists at both JPL and Johnson would work with their international partners to identify 7 candidate landing sites that would be the most geologically interesting, yet remain cautious of risk. It was determined that for the first landing, a flatter plain would be selected to minimize risk, yet a position near potential water outflow points was the ideal answer. Utopia Planitia, while geologically not incredibly interesting could represent a more safety conscious landing site. A wide flat plain would be ideal for testing the lander's mettle and minimizing EVA risk. Noachis Terra on the other hand, would represent the highest risk landing site, with a deeply cratered landscape surrounding high plains.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all, today we're exploring a side of the shuttle that is essential in understanding why it has its place in history. As you may have guessed, lots of internal safety culture stuff has been building in the Air Force, and now, it's come to a head. <u>I want to preface this chapter that it is heavy, and is a little bit upsetting, so do proceed with caution.</u> This is not a fun or happy story to tell, but it is an important one. That being said, let's explore the world of Proxima once more. <br>
