"WASHINGTON: Documents acquired by the Los Angeles Times in December, 1992 have revealed that the Air Force has been involved with, since their unfortunate accident with Valiant in 1987, a clandestine space program aimed at observation and intelligence gathering; both foreign and domestic. This represents a historic precedent in the way military oversight has ballooned beyond previous estimates. According to this historic document obtained by the Times, the Transatmospheric Vehicle program was a suborbital and orbital crew vehicle, which carried crew to and from a servicing and observation platform known as ODIN - the Orbital Defense Intel Network. It is believed that this program began as part of the Air Force’s initiative with their orbiter, and was in its early phases of construction when the vehicle was destroyed. The TAV vehicle consists, as we understand it, of a rocket boosted carrier plane and a Space Shuttle Orbiter sized crew vehicle, which can deliver cargo to and from a small orbital platform, believed to already be in orbit. Rumors in the astrophotography community about a large payload in a polar orbit had been discussed in circles, according to firsthand observers who wish to remain anonymous. Reports of UFO activity surrounding the Groom Lake facility in Nevada have also increased in previous years, suggesting that this was the potential base of operations of the Transatmospheric Vehicle Program, however, this remains unverified. So far, Air Force Strategic Command has refused to comment on the state of the program, but the evidence that this program has been in operation seems to be stacked against them. Included in this article are select pieces from our documentation that seem to indicate a normal series of operations for such a vehicle, including staging and turnaround time…"</span></p>
