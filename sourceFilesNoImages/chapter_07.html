  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">C</span><span class="calibre6">onstructing a fleet of Martian bound spacecraft in space would require a complex large enough to handle a spacecraft, while being modular in design to enable construction piece by piece. Skylab had been one story, a large, modular space station augmented by modules brought up by the Shuttle in the later years of its life, but the complex for Martian spacecraft would have to do a lot more. It would have to serve as a scientific platform for when MTVs were not present, and enable comfortable crew accommodations. The station would also be robust to handle the fleet of MTVs strict repair needs, and leverage all that had been learned in regards to orbital construction. The Odyssey Orbital Laboratory would serve this purpose, and would leverage the modular construction ability of the Shuttle system to launch it. The first launch of the program would be a somewhat new type of module for NASA’s human spaceflight program, a multi port node with its own avionics and propulsion elements, with six available ports that had been co-designed by the Soviets and Americans. The node was essentially a stretched SSIM, and would be capable of independent maneuvering in space. <i>Discovery</i> would roll out with the first node, named <i>Serenity</i>, and would launch late in the night to a 51.6º orbit, accessible by both major powers of the program. The node was almost as long as the cargo bay, and had fuel tanks pressed against the side of the hull, barely allowing for enough clearance between the cargo bay and the pressure vessel. Once on orbit, a process similar to the relocation of the Skylab Shuttle Interface Module would take place, moving the node to the docking port of the shuttle, and allowing for its solar panels to deploy. These solar panels would later be augmented by much larger panels on either end of the truss of the station.<i> Discovery’s</i> crew reported no issues, and successfully undocked from the nascent complex after 7 days on orbit. <i>Atlantis</i> would be the next to fly, carrying with it a unique truss element, as well as the mounting point for the station’s primary heavyweight robotic manipulator. The truss would serve as a tunnel between the two primary nodes of the station, in order to enable crews to work near the MTV, without wasting time on spacewalks translating around the truss. This truss segment also contained propellant tanks for <i>Serenity’s</i> thrusters, which were linked on EVA. The assembly work proved challenging, but easier than expected, only bolstering NASA’s confidence in their ability to assemble their fleet of Martian spacecraft. The next four flights would see the lower node, <i>Harmony</i>, delivered, another two truss segments, and the first of two massive deployable solar arrays, which would allow for further expansion of the station and move towards permanent crew operations. <br/>

On the ground, work was being done in preparation to ready the <i>Liberté</i> Crew Return Vehicle, a first of its kind lifting body produced via NASA-ESA consortium. In many ways, the CRV leveraged more from the American lifting body program than from that of the ESA <i>Hermés</i> program, which was rather quickly being wound down. Added complexity had doomed Hermés from the start, and the rather simple nature of the <i>Liberté</i> lifting body had been seen as the more attractive option, not to mention the cash influx from the American space program. Quietly, and without much fanfare, <i>Hermés</i> was dropped from ESA’s human spaceflight program, proceeding ahead with support on <i>Liberté</i>. In Europe, the cancellation of <i>Hermés</i> sparked controversy, with some member nations growing concerned about lack of independent crew access. ESA leadership, in response, would move to reassure their partners that <i>Liberté</i> would be a stepping stone towards independent crew access. The testing program was proceeding in the New Mexico desert, under NASA supervision. Using a series of complex drop tests, the lifting body could be tested at scale, with hopes of getting the vehicle fully certified for flight and crew rotation by 1988.  <br/>

<i>Discovery</i> made its first return to the station in the fall of 1984, carrying with it the <i>Quest</i> airlock, a portal for astronauts to move through to enable construction and servicing. It had been a relatively routine flight at this point, and every flight moved the station towards a permanent crew onboard. The crew docked on flight day two, and on flight day five, moved the airlock with the help of the station’s robotic arm. The station would soon reach “tended” capacity, usable as long as shuttles were present at the station, but not yet ready to support assembly of the Mars Transfer Vehicle fleet or independent science operations. However, for a moment, <i>Discovery</i> was not the only US spacecraft in space. <i>Valiant</i> had rolled out to SLC-6 for OF-11, its 11th overall mission for the Air Force. But this was not to be a normal mission… About a month prior, a Delta launch vehicle had pitched south over the Pacific ocean, carrying a payload to LEO known only as CheckPoint-1A. Not much else was known about it, other than it was definitely a military endeavor. Launching to the south, as all other missions from Vandenberg had done, <i>Valiant</i> made the ascent to orbit, ditching its external tank and boosters and opening her cargo bay. It would soon become clear what this mission would be: the fabled once around rendezvous which drove many of the Shuttle’s design choices, including the large cross-range capability provided by its delta wings. The shuttle’s launch was visible from the Odyssey Orbital Laboratory, and as it dipped below the horizon, the true nature of the mission was conducted. In less than 90 minutes, the crew would open their payload bay, grapple CheckPoint-1A, stow it, and prepare to land at Edwards. The 7 person crew on <i>Valiant</i>, and <i>Discovery’s</i> 7 person crew attending to the station, briefly set the record for humans in space, at 14. </span></p>

The orbiter re-entered, and proceeded to follow the landing pattern that was standard among shuttle operations, lazy S-turns towards the desert. The vehicle placed its landing gear firmly on the ground, and two and a half thousand miles away, a phone in the Pentagon rang. Confirmation of the Shuttle’s ability to capture such objects on quick rendezvous was a huge win for the Air Force, and a sign that they could feasibly push their orbiter much harder and faster than NASA could. Proposals for what to do with the orbiter had been pouring into the Pentagon, and soon, details for an emergent program to service telescopes, and perhaps even expand on concepts devised during the MOL program. Details about this mission would remain classified for over 10 years after the end of the rollout, with details only emerging in congressional hearings on Air Force management. But work on an idea, one in which the Air Force could have a presence in space, began.</span></p>

October of 1984 would see the next batch of solid rocket motors rolled out of Magna, Utah, and two motors from this batch would be shipped to Thiokol’s mountainside test stand for quality control firings, before being returned to the flightline. Testing conditions had never dipped below 60ºF during normal operation, and all shuttle launches to this point had also been conducted at temperatures well above this point. But weather conditions in both California and Florida had seen much lower temperatures of late, and officials from NASA were eager to identify any potential issues that may impact launches on their upcoming family of vehicles. One of the two quality control boosters was rolled onto the test stand, and ambient temperatures held steady at around 31ºF. The booster was lit, and around 50 seconds into the test firing, a burn through was noticed around one of the O-rings. These O-rings were designed to flex as the heat in the booster warmed them, but ambient air temperature had clearly prevented that kind of plasticity from occurring. The stack burned through its propellants, and engineers from NASA descended on the booster. A grounding of shuttle flights was considered, but instead, careful temperature checks would be conducted, ensuring that the booster's O-Rings never descended below 50ºF. Weeks of meetings would result in new operating parameters for the Shuttle and upcoming SDLV stack, and improved O-rings would fly as soon as the summer of 1985.       <br/>

As the end of 1984 approached, it became clear that Olympus had a problem potentially looming over it. The NERVA program had, in its infancy, been a troublesome beast. Engine testing had been unreliable and costly, and public fears about nuclear safety had warranted the shut down of the program. The NeXT program had been no different, with the test stand engines proving to be quite the challenge to wrangle. Performance was down, and there had been a moment of reckoning when engines were taken apart, to reveal nearly breached containment of the nuclear material. NASA knew, in its heart of hearts, that a chemical backup should be considered, and began a quiet study to ensure some form of contingency. Work leveraged on cryogenic propellants would translate to this “backup” program, and potential restarts of the J-2 program could be leveraged to power a series of expendable, staged vehicles. It would be up to the engineers working with the nuclear engine, and the MTV program as a whole, to deliver a reliable vehicle for the Olympus program. This was, in many ways, not optimal. A chemical redesign would be costly and require completely changing the mission architecture. However, a contender for a potential replacement would soon emerge. Based off of concepts for an engine known only as Project V, this engine had a higher projected thrust, lower weight and shorter burn times, maximizing their usefulness in the scope of the mission. This engine, known later as <i>Valkyrie</i>, seemed revolutionary on paper - but it left NASA with a difficult call to make. Would it be worth it to shut down NERVA-NeXT and move to this new engine, which had not spent any time on a test stand so far? Or would it be best to proceed, attempting to fix the inherent issues with NERVA-NeXT, with an eye open on the progress of Project V. Time would tell, but time was also running out for the selection of a new powerplant to get to Mars. <br/>
<br/>
<b>NOTE</b>: Project V is largely based on the specs for Timberwind, the engine developed by the Strategic Defense Initiative/DoE/USAF. ITTL, there is no SDI as competition with Russia for space based combat effectiveness is largely seen as irrelevant. Work in the aerospace sector surrounding nuclear engines would likely produce a number of designs that would compete with NERVA. Also of note: <i>Liberté </i>of this universe effectively resembles a scaled up IXV, the lifting body testbed that flew as a precursor to SpaceRider, but scaled up to accommodate crew members in the reclined position seen on the ARCV.</span></p>
