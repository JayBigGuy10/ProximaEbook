  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">O</span><span class="calibre6">n all sides of Project Olympus, things were well underway to move towards the next phase of the program, test flights. With the success of both the construction of Odyssey and Jupiter-OPAV, as well as final qualification builds of the Mars Surface Access Vehicle, engineers began to look at potential windows for the first prospective human arrival on Mars. All of the contractors for the Mars Transfer Vehicle, at the start of the year, were poised to begin delivery of their respective components to the launch site at Kennedy Space Center. While most of the assembly work in orbit would be carried out by the robotic limbs of the Odyssey Orbital Laboratory, there remained a crucial piece for more complex tasks, a permanent crew onboard to maintain the vehicles and perform fine servicing. Space Shuttle Challenger, in late January of 1990, was prepared for flight with a unique payload onboard; a smaller crew vehicle for the first orbital demonstration mission of the Liberté Crew Rescue Vehicle. This flight would also be unique in carrying 8 astronauts, simulating the six permanent crew members that would remain on station at all times, complemented by visiting shuttle crews throughout construction and refurbishment periods for the fleet of MTVs.<br>
<br>
Liberté-01, the second off the production line but the first equipped for orbital flight, was to be flown to Odyssey and mated with the station for a full operations demo mission, carried out with the assistance of <i>Challenger</i> on orbit. <i>Challenger</i> launched early in the morning on February 17th, 1990, and captured a beautiful orbital sunrise as the vehicle reached orbit, opening the payload bay doors to reveal the sleek vehicle tucked securely within. The crew, in a press conference on Flight Day 2, revealed the name of Liberté-01; <i>Comfort</i>, and announced the naming scheme for all 6 upcoming Liberte vehicles. The vehicles would be named after notable hospital or rescue ships, a nod to the role of the vehicle as an emergency lifeboat for the crew on orbit. <i>Comfort</i> was to be joined by <i>Solace, Haven, Repose, Hope</i> and <i>Refuge</i>. <i>Challenger</i> docked on flight day 3, and work began on moving the vehicle to one of the station’s open PMA ports with the help of the station’s remote manipulator system. The design of the station accommodated a variety of docking ports for easy storage and reconfiguration, and multiple logistics modules, short and long term labs, and more could be added and removed to accommodate downtime between upcoming Mars windows and other activities.</span></p>

With the installation of <i>Comfor</i>t on the station, the crew could begin the next phase of testing for the program. Under the watchful eye of mission control, the crew members boarded the CRV, and began to activate its systems. After the initial setup, the crew exited the craft, sealed the internal and external hatch and watched as their new spacecraft performed its magic. <i>Comfort</i> was then commanded autonomously to undock, and begin procedures to push away from the station. Exiting the keep out ellipsoid, the vehicle began to move around the station, the crew onboard <i>Challenger</i> photographing the delicate orbital ballet. Over the next hour, <i>Comfort</i> moved to a lower orbit, and prepared for the next and arguably most crucial test of the MTV’s systems, the entry and landing test. After 6 hours of free flight, <i>Comfort</i> would perform the deorbit burn, and commit to reentry on its own. This maneuver would bring the vehicle into the atmosphere, and line the vehicle up for a landing at White Sands. White Sands, not used for crew landing missions since the early days of the Shuttle program, would see a mass influx of crew reception operations, with the intent to replicate a mission in which a crew member, or multiple crew members, would be injured. Two helicopters, sixteen convoy trucks, and two Union Pacific trains full of support equipment would be brought in to receive the vehicle. A NASA-operated WB-57 high altitude research aircraft tracked the vehicle as it entered the upper atmosphere, and, similarly to the shuttle, performed a series of lazy S-turns to slow itself down. Soon, helicopters were in the air and the tracking cameras fixed on a point in the sky, soon highlighted by the drogue chute. Contact was quickly re-established with the vehicle, and soon, the main chutes deployed, followed by the landing skids on the CRV. Winds were calm in the recovery area, and crews followed the vehicle as it touched down on its skids, and pyrotechnic pins cut the chutes. The vehicle, dirtied from its journey through the atmosphere, stood ready to start its operational life.

Meanwhile, nearly 3,000 miles away in Florida, CRV-02 began integration with its orbital module, to be launched within the next several months for the first operational flight. In High Bays 1, 2, and 3, three vehicles began their prep work for the first launches of a flurry of assembly missions, the construction of MTV-1. <i>Minerva’s</i> first component would consist of the Utility Node, a module resembling the two large nodes already on station. This node would also contain the airlock module used onboard the MTV, enabling crews to perform deep space EVAs if needed. Space Shuttle <i>Discovery </i>would be prepped for the mission in High Bay 1, waiting for the next rotation of CRV-02 <i>Solace</i> onboard <i>Atlantis</i>, which carried six crew members into orbit and began permanent crew operations of the Odyssey Orbital Laboratory after integration in High Bay 2. After a successful launch  on May 6th, the crew of <i>Solace</i> could begin permanent operations as Odyssey Crew-1. With the crew secure on station, and <i>Atlantis</i> returning home, <i>Discovery</i> could be rolled out to the pad. Unfortunately for the module, and the shuttle’s crew, it would have to wait, as a tropical depression forced the rollback of the orbiter into the VAB.  <i>Discovery</i> successfully launched the Utility Node to Odyssey on May 27th, with Crew-1 assisting the shuttle in moving the first piece of the MTV into place. The node was plugged into the station’s power system, and the age of in-space ship assembly began. Discovery remained on station for 12 days, bringing with it as much cargo as they could fit into the middeck to support the outfitting of the new spacecraft component. In a public teleconference, with beamed shots from Odyssey, the names of the upcoming Mars Transfer Vehicles would be announced: <i>Minerva, Prometheus</i> and <i>Hera</i>.</span></p>

Two weeks after <i>Discovery’s</i> departure, the next key component of the MTV would be readied for launch, arguably the most risky and technologically novel. To accommodate astronauts on their journey to and from Mars, ample space would be required for lab work, sleep, and personal space. Rolling out of High Bay 3, a Jupiter-OPAV stack with OV-203 <i>Endurance</i> made the long journey to the pad. After a nominal countdown, it was launched on July 6, 1990, proving the reliability of the OPAV modules once again. <i>Endurance</i>, completing its mission to bring the payload to orbit, would make a picture perfect landing in White Sands The vehicle, approaching the station for grappling, was a strange reminder of its functionality. It appeared… strange to the astronauts onboard Odyssey, accustomed to the solid modules installed on their structure. The tug that had carried it from the core stage of Jupiter held position as the station’s robotic arm grappled the strange object and mated it to the front of the Utility Node. The next few days were considerably tense as the onboard gas cylinders expelled their contents to inflate the habitat, and soon, the true diameter of the payload would be revealed. Its structure was massive, its 8.25 meter diameter dwarfing the 4.2 meter station modules and Utility Node. Crews were soon able to venture inside the massive structure and begin to outfit the spacecraft’s centrally mounted payload racks with equipment. The structure was unlike anything crews had ever worked with in space before, but deployment was flawless, and topping up of the onboard inflation system’s gas reserves was handled by resupply from <i>Endeavour</i>.<br>
<br>
Back on Earth, the first modules of the propulsion elements of the Mars Transfer Vehicle were delivered to Cape Canaveral. At the time of their launch, these were some of the largest components ever to be launched into orbit, while still being relatively light in terms of overall payload mass. Derived from the Space Shuttle hydrogen tank, and using the same tooling, these tanks proved to be a far easier conversion than planned, and dwarfed Saturn-era Mars plans in sheer volume. The propulsion system of the MTV was split into parts; the twin slush hydrogen tanks of the core, the drop tanks, the propulsion element which consisted of 3 Valkyrie engines, and the thermal and power management systems which would hitch a ride on the tanks. In order to maximize reuse effectiveness of the MTV as a whole, a solution was devised to attach drop tanks to the second propulsion segment, which would be deposited in pairs as the vehicle performed maneuvers, allowing the core section to return to Earth for refurbishing. The drive section, compared to the two tanks, was rather stubby, but looked remarkably strange. The 3 Valkyrie engines would be launched facing up relative to the direction of travel to ease the strain on the vehicle during ascent. Three of the four high bays in the VAB would be in use, limited only by the fourth MLP being down for maintenance. The first payload, with its skin tight payload fairing, would roll to the pad in early Q3, a unique callback to the Apollo’s Skylab program with its MMOD fairing. This was selected over the idea to completely encapsulate the payload, as this would add unnecessary weight to the system. In the case of the drive section, a payload aero adapter would be placed over the engine bells to protect them during launch, resulting in a short and stubby fairing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
The first launch of these segments, Propulsion Segment 1, went off without a hitch, riding on OV-204 <i>Inspiration</i> for the 8 ½ minute climb to orbit. The engines shut down, and soon, the tank was flying free, ready to transfer the element to the waiting Odyssey crew. The vehicle, in comparison to the tanks it rode up on, looked alien and futuristic, its insulating gold foil and spidery adapter contrasting sharply to both the external tank and modules of Odyssey. Despite the size of the tanks, they were still mostly empty space, and still very easy to maneuver by both the station tugs and robotic arms. The rest of the components for the MTV followed equally painless launches, and with the arrival of the next CRV crew, work could begin on outfitting this first of its kind behemoth for a battery of tests, and ultimately, the voyage to Mars. The outfitting work carried out on the station would be an area of Russian expertise, their experimentation with extendable crane structures would enable linkages to be made across the tanks and simplify construction. Soon, the largest structure assembled in space would grow even larger, as Shuttle crews brought supplies and equipment to the newborn MTV.</span></p>
