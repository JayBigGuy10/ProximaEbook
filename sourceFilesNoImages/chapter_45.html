  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">F</span><span class="calibre6">or Olympus 15, the addition of a larger habitat space and more room to grow was something of a blessing, even though their configuration of the base would end up being the smallest. Their time on the surface had seen massive expansion to the nascent Foundation, and journeys on foot and unpressurized rovers had revealed an intricate network of potential aquifers, and evidence of water once carving out the mammoth valley in which they stood. Some of the first orders of business for the base crew were setting up power and fuel processing stations, something that would be useful for future fleets of reusable landers arriving to and departing from Foundation. Nuclear power had proven its worth on Mars, so secured behind a berm on the far side of the base sat the Power Pack, a group of reactors and high density lithium ion batteries, buried in regolith for shielding, that would act as the primary sources of power for the facility. After the setup of crucial infrastructure, the next most important test for the crew would be the checkout of Enterprise, who sat ever so patiently near the base. While back on Earth, the crew had the opportunity to tour the production facilities of the Phoenix MADVs, but the scale of the vehicle on the surface had been something else. Trundling over in their unpressurized rovers, the crew would marvel at her design, and take the time to ride the elevator up to her flight deck, inspecting her facilities. Compared to the MSAV vehicles, <i>Enterprise</i> was a dream. Everything was pristine, so new and modular, ready to serve not once, but multiple times over. Her black-grey exterior stood in stark contrast to the red-orange hues of the landscape, and the wind whipped dust ever so delicately around it. Despite all of their engineering objectives, there was still science to be done - continuation of greenhouse experiments, geological surveys and more. As the crew of Olympus 15 boarded <i>Hydra</i> for their departure to the Base Station, they took a moment to reflect. The final dip in the water had been undertaken, now it was time for the flood, the first big step into a world unknown. And one final test remained. Docking with the complex in orbit was a standard affair, and the crew tiredly filed out, eager to begin the process of returning home. Supplies were offloaded, and <i>Hydra</i> was cast off, freeing the docking port on the Base Station side. The crew would crowd into the cupola to watch, as this intrepid little remnant of a spacecraft would vanish from view, left to orbit Mars, for now, before the pull of the thin atmosphere and gravity would take hold, ripping her from orbit and sealing her fate. As <i>Hydra</i> drifted further and further from the Base Station, <i>Enterprise</i>, sitting dormant on the surface, would begin to power up her systems, preparing for what was to come. At Noctis Landing, the silence was broken, a deep, reverberating crack piercing the landscape as the 6 main engines roared to life, breaking the thousands of years of unending peace the planet had endured. The vehicle rose, clearing the canyon walls, beginning to pitch over as it sliced through the atmosphere. Electronic eyes working overtime, the vehicle began to scan its surroundings, like some great beast - looking for its target sitting above. As the atmosphere loosened its grip, the crew onboard the station would begin to look for the thermal signature of the vehicle, a bright spot against the cold background of the planet. Julie Diaz Peña, the CASASE Mission Specialist from Argentina, would be the first to spot her, as the vehicle illuminated her locator beacons. Humanity had done it, a new, reusable lander fully tested in Martian space. As the gargantuan vehicle closed in on the docking port, and made contact with the soft capture ring, the crew of Olympus 15 could rest easy - their job at Mars at last complete.</span></p>

After checking out the refueling systems, the crew would board their MTV and head home, at last able to rest. As Selene would slip into orbit of the Earth all of those months later, <i>Intrepid</i> would spread her wings one final time - one last job. One last ride into greatness. As <i>Intrepid</i> circled the MTV, moving ever closer to the gargantuan spacecraft, many realized that this was the last time that a shuttle would dock with one of these great vehicles - the last meeting of titans. An iconic symbol of human spaceflight coming to an end, while heralding a new beginning. As they said their farewell, and the payload bay doors would close, the crew on board could rest, the pull of gravity a strange comfort once more. In the purple light of dusk, the double sonic booms of Intrepid shook Titusville once more. With a jolt, her wheels graced the concrete, and at long last her journey could end. A final moment of peace, and solace, for the Martian Support Orbiter. <br>

<i>“Proceeding with final poll... Guidance… Go! Propulsion… Go! Comms… Go! ECLSS… Go! Cryogenics… Go! AFTS… Go! Launch Director… You are clear to proceed… Range? Range is green! Roger that Range and LD, Clipper, you are go for launch!”</i></div><br>
On Pad 41, Olympus 16 sat atop their Atlas EvO rocket, steaming in the early sunrise warmth. Inside, an international crew sat ready to proceed with the adventure of a lifetime, 8 individuals chosen because they were the best and brightest of them all. ACEV <i>Clipper</i>, the third off the line, stood proudly, waiting for her moment to shine. The first ACEV vehicle for a deep space sortie, she had been equipped with the latest modifications to support the long journey, including her role as a lifeboat. Waiting diligently in orbit was MTV-01, <i>Minerva</i>, the longest lived out of any deep space vehicle humanity had ever constructed. She sat, ever so patiently, having just been topped up on fuel by the Jupiter-OPAV fleet. This mission, Olympus 16, marked the start of the next phase of human exploration of the Red Planet - one that was truly sustainable and ready to carry the program for the next good, long while. A nearly full-reuse Mars Transfer Vehicle coupled with a new, reusable lifeboat, as well as a lander that could be serviced and fueled at Mars - these were the elements that made the program successful. As the time ticked lower still, Anna stood atop the VAB, binoculars in hand. She didn’t really need them, she knew exactly where to look. In the days before the crew had gone into quarantine, she had spent some time with the next 8, sharing her advice, and feelings. But there was a disconnect now, a distance between the astronauts she had been recruited with and these fresh faces. A gap between them that seemed nearly impassable. With every launch, every crew rotation, the distance grew. And her role as chief astronaut seemed… not fit for her anymore. But that wasn’t a discussion for right now, right now what mattered was the crew on the pad. Over the PA systems, and on live streams blaring from phones across the complex, the count reached zero, and the rumble of engines was overshadowed by the gun-like crack of the solid rocket boosters igniting. The roar washed over the facility, and the childlike wonder returned to Anna’s heart for a moment, fluttering as she watched the crew clear the tower, beginning the journey of a lifetime. Alexander Vilko, the commander of the Olympus 16 crew, would call out their roll program and report that they were feeling good, having the time of their lives. Just like Anna had nearly 23 years ago. A lifetime ago. Faster and higher, the vehicle would climb, every whip like crack of the acoustic environment slamming into the Florida coast with a fury so strangely artificial. Soon, the vehicle would be out of view, well on their way towards their waiting MTV, and Anna would step off the roof of the VAB once more. The usual pleasantries of launch had worn off, and the weight of reality rested its hands upon her shoulders. As she climbed down the stairs and headed inside the gargantuan building, she noticed how uncomfortable she had become. The Florida heat did not feel like a portal to a new world, it felt familiar and almost cloying now, so stagnant and still. Claustrophobic. Like she’d been sitting in it for too long. She found herself falling into her own mind once again, the levels of the VAB passing by her as she descended in the rickety elevator, a place where she had spent so much time preparing for what was to come. <i>Perhaps</i>, she thought to herself, <i>perhaps the journey here is coming to an end. Perhaps I can let go. </i>Without a word, she would pick up her phone, and call Sergei. He would know what to do.</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
As Atlas and Centaur finished their job, the crew of Olympus 16 would soon be greeted with the sight of a lifetime, their great ship <i>Minerva</i> waiting for them in orbit. A veteran of five Olympus missions, she was one of the most well traveled objects in human history, with an odometer reading of well over three billion miles. She sat, as elegant as ever, glistening in the orbital sun. A symbol, nay, a gateway to worlds beyond. The crew onboard <i>Clipper</i> would conduct a flyaround, inspecting the great ship as they inched ever closer. She of course showed signs of aging, singing on her fuselage from thruster burns, yellowing on her modules. But parts remained new, constantly replaced in the orbital shipyard of Gateway. Her solar panels, for instance, had just recently been replaced with new, fresh models. They looked nearly identical, but could generate nearly double the power of her originals. Her coolant system had also been worked on, installing more energy efficient cooling pumps to ensure that her fuel remained adequately chilled throughout her voyage. Laser communications systems, designed to enable higher data rate transmission over great distances, had also been installed, ready for her next phase of voyages to the Red Planet. <i>Clipper</i> would move ever closer, finally coming to rest at the forward port, rather than the port that had hosted the Earth Return Lifeboat for all of these years. Successfully bolting the two spacecraft together, the crew would take their time unloading what cargo they brought with them onboard Clipper, and begin to wait for the next and final component to be launched before their departure. Roughly 10 days later, an Atlas EvO rocket would roll out to the pad, a Cygnus spacecraft tucked inside its payload fairing. This quick turnaround was exactly the kind of cadence the program needed, and Cygnus would soon leap from the pad to rendezvous with the MTV, waiting ever so gracefully in orbit. Despite all of the hours of operation of this spacecraft, all of the lessons learned, it still felt somehow… not correct to have the shuttle there, watching over the spacecraft it in part helped assemble. Like a child going off to school, unsupervised. Vilko and his team would work diligently, nearly all with at least some spaceflight experience, to clear out the cargo stored onboard the spacecraft before casting it off to be disposed of in the fiery clutches of the atmosphere. At last, their moment was here - a moment that 24 years ago, Anna Douglass and her crew had been anticipating: Trans Mars Injection. Strapping into their seats on the flight deck, Vilko and his pilot, JAXA’s Koichi Satoh, would turn the keys once more, committing the very same MTV to flight. The engines would roar to life, and the vibrations of the maneuver would be felt throughout the spacecraft, all part of a complex series of events required to send the crew on their way. Those on the ground who knew to look would cast their eyes up, trying to find this new speck of light that indicated humanity’s departure. As the engines finished their job, and the spacecraft was at last free of the Earth’s gravity, Vilko felt himself return to flight deck - a seat that had not felt like it was his alone. It belonged to everyone who had come before him, and everyone who would come after. Humanity’s seat. In the nearly 4 decades since this program had begun, over 100 people had made it to Mars, and hundreds more had flown to the variety of outposts in Low Earth orbit. As the ship moved to its quiescent cruise state, and the Earth faded from view, Vilko could not help but wonder - where else was there to go? In that moment, he could have sworn the moon shone a bit brighter…          <br>

  <i>A meeting of giants, Sabre and Discovery sit and talk shop at Horizon - as powerful a symbol of handing the torch if ever there was one.</i>
</span></p>

  <br/> 

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
In the fall of 2020, two giants sat suspended in orbit, one of the great meetings of modern spaceflight. Past and present sat opposed on each end of Horizon, Venturestar <i>Sabre</i> and Space Shuttle <i>Discovery</i>. What was slated to be a simple multi-month investigation had turned into a year, with Venturestar’s return to flight being a necessary Odyssey supply run. <i>Discovery</i> had been tasked with delivering the next Expedition crew aboard Liberté, the last such rotation of its kind before the Zenit launched configuration would take over for the dedicated orbiter fleet. Her departure from the pad had been a tough one, as hurricane after hurricane pounded the Florida coastline. Taking shelter inside the VAB, <i>Discovery</i> endured as she always had, one of the toughest orbiters of the fleet. Soon, the skies would clear, and she would make one last reach for the stars. After 8 ½ minutes, she would cast her External Tank off for the final time, and begin the journey to Horizon under her own power. Not a week later, Venturestar would rumble off of her pad, engines barking and snorting in the thick Florida air. Enthusiasts from all over the country had gathered to watch this historic launch, the first time these two vehicles were slated to meet in space. There had been some uncertainty as to whether or not <i>Sabre</i> would get off the pad, a second round of hurricanes sat menacingly offshore, waiting to strike. However, luck was on the great new vehicle's side. Now, safely in space, she could open her payload bay doors and make her approach to Horizon, waiting two days to ensure all systems were operational on orbit. As Venturestar circled underneath the station, there was a moment of realization of what the crew were looking at - the future. The future of cargo spaceflight to stations in LEO. The Kennedy Incident had certainly made mission planners wary, but engine acceptance testing on the pad for the full duration of flight had brought confidence back to the program. It had not been an easy start, but Venturestar would come to rest at last, ready to unload the MPLM she carried onboard for the expedition crew. <i>Discovery</i> would cast off from Horizon 3 days later, her final few days of flight before her wings would carry her no more. As the crew watched her depart, one of the mission specialists noticed a sticker near the port recently vacated by the veteran orbiter, reading: “Real Spaceships Have Wings.” <i>Discovery</i> would perform her lazy S-Turns as she made her way towards the Cape, the setting sun bringing an air of calm to the flight deck. The runway of the Shuttle Landing Facility would soon come into view, and the crew would guide her ever closer, inch by inch carefully monitored by the onboard computers. Now, less than 1,000 feet remained between the crew and the end of a journey of a lifetime, the altimeter ticking like a New Year’s countdown. Ever so gently, <i>Discovery</i> planted her back wheels on the tarmac, the rush of wind across the cockpit windows dying down ever so gently as they slowed. She was down, for the last time. Her body still warm, she slowed to a stop as she rolled into the evening, coming to rest at the end of the runway, still for the first time in so many years. <i>Discovery</i> had finished her journey, finally at peace. </span></p>
