  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Good afternoon everyone!, I hope you all had a restful week, and have been enjoying the beginning of the end of summer (in the Northern Hemisphere at least). This week, we're taking a look at a variety of things, and getting our bearings for the next phase of human exploration. I have two people I want to thank this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> for providing some of my favorite images of the entire series so far, and <a href="https://twitter.com/4possumsinacoat" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Peter</a> for being a really wonderful technical advisor. Without either of them, I think this series would be far less interesting. Anyway, I'm very excited to dive right in, so let's get to it!</span></p>
