  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Good morning everyone, I hope you all enjoyed this week's chapter, and are all looking forward to the future of Proxima. This week, we're working with my lovely illustrator <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a>. I also wanted to include some art done by my friend and collaborator <a href="https://twitter.com/FearlessBirb" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Borb</a> who has been immensely helpful as a sounding board! I realized earlier this week that I hadn't actually shown off the MSAV Transfer Element before, so, here we go! In this installment, we'll look at that aforementioned Transfer Element and some shots of Olympus 10's departure to Mars. I really hope you enjoy!</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Good morning all!, Today I wanted to showcase some incredible images from our good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay,</a> and talk about a new entry into our lineup of spacecraft/space stations, and why I think it will continue to be an important asset in Proxima for years to come. The Gateway Logistics station is a station designed to be mobile, designed to move around and rendezvous with different equipment in different orbits, and act as a servicing platform rather than a full time tended space station. The station is small, and built around a multifunctional node, enabling it to be reconfigured for a variety of different roles throughout its life (Maybe there's a little ODIN heritage in there, who knows). Gateway is equipped with a unique feature, an ion thruster assembly, to allow it to maneuver across a variety of orbits to service different payloads, and reach a variety of targets without spending  a lot of fuel. Later additions will see tugs coupled with Gateway to enable more wide-reaching servicing. Potential applications that we'll see in Proxima include MTV servicing, satellite servicing, in space construction and more. Much of my inspiration for Gateway came from the real life Gateway being constructed for the Artemis program, and some came from the Exploration Platform that was proposed in the weird proto-Artemis stage circa 2012-2017. I wanted to showcase Gateway in its initial operating configuration, having been put together by <i>Challenger</i> in the Summer of 2008, and give you guys a taste of the future of Proxima. This is not our only new station to join the party, however, we have lots more to come.</span></p>

  <i>The station largely ready to go, Gateway deploys her massive solar arrays, ready to start generating power for the facility and providing power to Challenger.</i>

  <i>While the physical modules of the station are small, her solar arrays are required to be large in order to generate power for the ion drive, and power supplementary systems. This iconic "power tower" is derived from station concepts of old.</i>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Good morning everyone!, I hope you have had a great weekend, and are looking forward to a great week ahead. This week, we're taking a step back from our Martian operations and focusing on some special places and things - Space ships and Stations! We'll be delving into what Europe has been up to, and setting the stage for some big leaps in spaceflight. For the Americans, we'll be exploring how Gateway has expanded since we last checked in during 2008. I wanna thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> for his hard work supporting this project, always a trooper! I also wanna thank <a href="https://twitter.com/salyutseven" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ben</a>, who has been doing such amazing work on the music for Proxima, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9AtoXQ9RSmBSiqMSu8332SaDP699COp" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">which you can check out here</a>. Anyway, on with the show!</span></p>
