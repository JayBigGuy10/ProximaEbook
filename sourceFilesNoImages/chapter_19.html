  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">O</span><span class="calibre6">dyssey, after the birth of the final MTV, had begun its transformation into a new being. No longer was the station merely a place where these great ships could be worked on, but other vehicles bound for the outer Solar System could be constructed. The first such vehicle that would use Odyssey as its gateway to the stars would be Cassini, a joint exploration initiative between ESA and NASA. Originally, the vehicle had been proposed to launch onboard a Titan IV rocket from Kennedy Space Center. However, recent quality control concerns for the Titan family had put ESA on edge, and reluctance to launch on this vehicle was palpable. Titan had recently had a failure on a National Reconnaissance Office flight from Vandenberg, resulting in a dramatic destruction of the vehicle over the California coast. Both the Delta 8000, now renamed the Delta III, and Helios vehicles would not be available in time for the window, so a drastic restructuring of the program would take place. The plan, as of March 1996, would be to launch Cassini into space onboard a Shuttle flight in 1997, and deliver it to Odyssey onboard a special pallet. This pallet, the Odyssey Removable Cargo Shelter (ORCS), would be removed from the Shuttle cargo bay and stored on the truss, sheltered from the harsh environment of Low Earth Orbit. Later, the transfer stage, a 3 segment Inertial Upper Stage, would be launched and mated to the vehicle, and deployed from Odyssey to begin its billion mile trek to Saturn by way of Venus. Within the Solar System Exploration Office, this came as somewhat of a blessing in disguise. This was the perfect opportunity to demonstrate the aggregation techniques perfected in space by the Olympus program. No longer would one rocket limit the size of payloads, rather, vehicles could be massed in space, and mated to the appropriate upper stage. This got gears turning, and soon, NASA and their partners would begin to look at even larger missions, such as IGOR - the Icy Giants Recon Orbiters, a plan to take the Uranus and Neptune system by storm. Hubble had been, since its launch in 1990, serviced twice, and plans were already underway to construct even more powerful telescopes to aid in the exploration of the Universe. Such grandiose designs included multi-segment mirrors, coated in beryllium and gold, able to peer back to the beginning of time itself. Looking inwards, the Magellan spacecraft had entered its 7th year of operation, and was revealing much more about the planet than expected. Follow up synthetic aperture radar missions were soon to enter development, but those within the Olympus program office made note of a very interesting potential opportunity in the summer of 1999, the opportunity to perhaps view a new world with human eyes.<br>
<br>
July of 1996 would bring with it the piercing of the summer silence in Kazakhstan. An Energia stack, titanic in scale, would break through the gray-green landscape and bathe the steppes in light. Sleepy villages would turn their focus to the skies as the great vehicle climbed towards the stars. Onboard, the first Martian bound MSAV, Serial Number 01; <i>Zephyr</i> sat waiting to feel the cold expanse of space against its metal skin. The boosters, having performed their job, would fall away, destined to impact the empty steppes. The core stage would continue to climb, bringing the lander to the brink of orbit, just low enough that the pull of drag and gravity would bring it crashing down over the Pacific Ocean.  Separating from the gargantuan core, <i>Zephyr</i> would fire its reaction control jets, allowing the lander to coast into its parking orbit, slightly lower than the MTV train and twin stations. There, it would wait ever so patiently as the next pieces of the puzzle would soon be lofted into orbit by a series of Jupiter-OPAV stacks. OV-201 <i>Adventure</i>, OV-203 <i>Endurance</i> and OV-204 <i>Inspiration</i> would loft the core stage of a single engined MTV, dubbed the Transfer Element, which would power the lander to Mars once the window opened later in the year. The lander would remain in this loiter orbit until late December, when the transfer window opened, and would join the crew in their departure to the Red Planet. August of this year would see a 5 person checkout crew onboard <i>Challenger</i> visit the lander in orbit, as they prepared the vehicle for departure prior to its fueling campaign, which began in September. The vehicle, after a series of tests, and fueling completion, would stand poised to discover the wonders of the Red Planet, and enable humans to walk upon its surface for the first time.     <br>
<br>
The time to say goodbye to planet Earth had finally come for the crew of Olympus 3. As they concluded their training, and prepared to enter quarantine for departure, the families of the astronauts were given a week to spend with their loved ones at the series of beach houses NASA owned along the Florida coast. For the crew, it would be the last time they would spend in the serene calm of the Earth’s biosphere, with nothing artificial standing between them and the ever deadly expanse of the long dark. The crew would watch as a Jupiter-OPAV stack would bring the last bits of fuel up to their waiting vessel, <i>Minerva</i>, and the crews onboard Odyssey and <i>Zarya</i> would call to wish them well on their voyage. While some took the time to enjoy the outdoors, wading ankle deep into the Atlantic, the mission’s commander, Anna Douglass, would spend her time keeping a carefully crafted private journal, detailing her thoughts on the work that was ahead of her, and the person she’d leave behind on planet Earth. <i>It is, in many ways, a departure of the self,</i> she wrote, November 3rd 1996, <i>I am poised to leave behind the woman who I was on this world, and become someone new on another. Who will that Anna Douglass be? Will my mother recognize her? Will she be the hero that my crew mates might need, or will she, like her crewmates, succumb to the tide of the great ocean between worlds? I do not know, at present, but all of my training allows me to face this uncertainty with resolve, headstrong and in the company of the bravest god damn sons of bitches I’ve ever met.</i> Those words, released years later, would reflect on the humanity of the crew, and their bravery in facing the unknown, and be immortalized as some of the most important prose of the early days of the Olympus program.</span></p>

The launch date for the crew of Olympus 3, and the crew of <i>Intrepid</i>, would soon come. The vehicle’s rollout to the pad was slow and steady as always, but was flanked with the press, eager to catch a glimpse of the first step towards the Red Planet. The Mars-bound crew would make their way to the pad in the Astro Van with their support crew; Commander Dell Wayne Conagher of NASA, Darcie Philip Noolieah of ESA and Thomas Bunchantha of NASA, as well as a fourth crew member, CNN correspondent Michaela Barrowman. Barrowman had long been the spaceflight enthusiast of the press corps, having given up her dreams to become an astronaut amid the lack of inclusivity in the immediate post Apollo Era. After befriending the Olympus 3 mission commander, her world changed entirely, and she found herself sitting on the flight deck of Intrepid, ready to document some of the last views of Earth for the Martian bound crew. On December 11th, 1996, Space Shuttle <i>Intrepid</i> and her 12 crew members would lift off from Pad 39A, and pitch over towards the horizon as the crew prepared for their encounter with destiny. The words of the launch commentator would ring in the ears of millions, as they tuned in to watch the orbiter climb into the heavens; “And we have liftoff of Olympus 3's Crew Delivery flight, carrying the first international, human crew to explore the Red Planet, taking us higher and further than ever before. Godspeed!” Slipping into orbit, the crew could begin to grow accustomed to microgravity, and begin the chase to encounter their home away from home, <i>Minerva</i>. She was, for all who flew in her, a fine ship, born and bred to spread her wings among the stars. Her solar arrays glinted in the sunlight as <i>Intrepid</i> began her final approach. Docking was achieved on flight day 4, delayed slightly due to an antenna issue onboard the orbiter, and the crew worked to open the hatch and empty cargo from the orbiter’s middeck extension. <i>Intrepid</i> spent 7 days on orbit with the crew, preparing the ship and its complement, with Barrowman attempting to maneuver around the vehicle and film their crew. During these emotional days, she would record the most intimate moments of crew life, and their final views of planet Earth as they prepared their spacecraft. During their joint flight, they conducted an inspection of their lander, <i>Zephyr</i>, as it sat in orbit ahead of them. The vehicle, unlike <i>Monitor</i> before it, would bear markings of purpose, adorned with the flags of every participating nation. <i>Intrepid</i> would, on their departure on December 18th, conduct a historic flyaround of the great spacecraft, sitting in Low Earth Orbit with her solar arrays deployed, ready to take flight and set course for the Red Planet. On Christmas Eve, mission controllers in Houston, Cologne and Moscow made the final agreement to commit to the burn, and send the crew on their way. It was time.</span></p>

The first component of departure would be the lander, which had been moved to a slightly higher orbit overnight by way of its Orbital Maneuvering System engines. Well outside of the 70 km keep out zone for a nuclear engine burn, the MSAV and its departure stage ignited its engine on the morning of December 25th, 1996. The burn was successful, and was imaged in great detail from crews on the ground, and the first component of the 1996 window was away. Soon, it would be time for the crew of Minerva to do the same. Mission control, reviewing the data from the departure burn of <i>Zephyr</i>, would soon make the call, <i>Minerva</i> was GO for reactor ignition and Trans-Mars-Injection. The crew, after final video messages were sent down to Earth to their loved ones, would make their way to the flight deck at the forward end of the vehicle, and prepare themselves. Commander Douglass and the MTV Pilot, Thomas Douglas Smith, would give the ship a thorough once over, before they too took their seats, and turned the keys for reactor ignition. The control drum actuators would move into position, and soon, hydrogen was flowing into the engine bell, flash heated to thousands of degrees. In an instant, the crew were pressed into their couches, and the great rumbling vibration of the nuclear engines would be accompanied by the tick of the geiger counter, never faltering from its steady series of clicks. The engine bells of the Valkyries would glow with the heat of nuclear decay, dissipated into space by the great radiator wings. Each member of the crew would count the seconds that passed, feeling the force of the engines pressing into their backs. The trajectory computer would show them traveling further and further, spiraling out into the inky void of space, towards a destination not yet seen. And just as suddenly as the force of the engines pressed them into their seats, it would stop. Soon, silence would fill the cabin once more, and the crew sat suspended in silence as the shock of what had just happened washed over them. These 8 people, from all over the world, had commanded a great spacecraft to take them on the longest voyage humanity had ever undertaken. As they unbuckled themselves from their acceleration couches, they started to embrace quietly; they all knew where they were headed, yet, were descending further into the unknown than any humans before them. It was, as Commander Douglass later reflected, a moment she was glad a journalist never saw. The silence was broken only by mission control, making contact once again with the crew: “<i>Minerva</i>, Houston, we have you on a good Trans-Martian trajectory, and have good health data from the spacecraft. From all of us on planet Earth, we wish you well, godspeed and a very merry Christmas. There’s someone else here who’d like to say a few words…” As CAPCOM handed off the mic, it soon became clear who they’d be speaking with. A familiar, warm voice came through the speaker, Carl Sagan’s. “Hello <i>Minerva</i>, I hope the first step of your great journey was not too unpleasant. I want to say thank you for all you are undertaking for the better understanding of our universe… I cannot even begin to comprehend what wonders you will encounter, what strange footsteps you will leave on another world. There are a great many burdens with you now, many tasks to accomplish, but in my selfishness, I ask that you bring a piece of Mars home for me, so I may touch it for myself. I do certainly wish that I could join you on this journey, but it is yours, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts when you come home. You are truly our bravest explorers, and your names will be remembered for years to come. Merry Christmas, all.”</span></p>

With Sagan’s words ringing in their ears, the crew could finally get to work on preparing the ship for the long road ahead. The first priority would be aligning the large antenna with the Deep Space Network, rather than the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, and ensuring the spacecraft was set for cruise. The ship’s robotic arm, Canadarm-M, could be unlatched and used for inspection and to assist the crew in the event of an EVA. This would soon come in handy, as about a month into the journey, the drive mechanism for the tracking system on the high gain antenna would experience a fault, resulting in Koch, Bromley and Shoemaker making an unscheduled EVA to inspect it. It was not an uncalled for possibility that they would have to exit the spacecraft, but it was one that they were hoping to not have to do. As opposed to EVAs near Earth, they would not have the voice of Mission Control in their ears to guide them, nor would they have a well rehearsed plan for something of this nature. As they traversed the spacecraft, they made sure to remain focused on the ship itself, and not let their field of vision stray towards the infinite blackness. Working carefully, they inspected the drive element, and identified the source of the problem, a stray metal shaving had become lodged in the mechanism, which was extracted with a set of fine control pliers. Koch, Bromley and Shoemaker, on their return back to the airlock, took the time to inspect the variety of scientific packages attached to the body of the spacecraft. The ships surface, a messy collection of antennas and experiments, and their pressure vessel, would be all that stood between space and a breathable atmosphere. After five and a half hours outside, the astronauts would venture into the comfort of <i>Minerva </i>once more. Adjustment to life in deep space, for the crew, was an ever changing experience. As their home slipped further away, the delay in communications became more apparent. This was to be expected, as the crew had trained extensively for every portion of their mission, and knew they’d be operating largely independently from Mission Control. It was, in some ways, isolating, but the camaraderie shared by the crewmembers of the mission kept them focused and level headed. Soon, communication between Earth and <i>Minerva</i> would be reduced to uplink and downlink packets, and the crew hurtled further into the unknown.</span></p>
