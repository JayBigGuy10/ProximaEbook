  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all!, I'm really glad you all seemed to have enjoyed this week's chapter, as we look towards the future of operations on the surface of Mars. The roadmap for what we have to learn is in plain sight now and I cannot wait to explore more of what our Olympus missions will uncover. Right now, I've started to work on the next phase of our story, and we'll definitely see more operations from a broader point of view while still exploring the complex ways in which this architecture enables exploration. This week, we're gonna be taking a look at some art from <a href="https://twitter.com/salyutseven" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ben</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a>, who have once again shown their talent at designing and envisioning complex scenarios for this story. Make sure to please give them some love on twitter!</span></p>

  <i>After careful review of the flight logs from the Mars Base Station, the crew of Olympus 3 makes a shocking discovery - the station's autonomous scanning equipment managed to image Zephyr as it descended through the atmosphere towards Elysium Planitia. This got mission planners thinking, could a smaller orbiter capture such an image?

  <i>With the surface sortie of Olympus 3 over, the crew lifts off from the flatlands of Elysium Planitia, headed for a rendezvous in orbit with their waiting MTV and Base Station. The main engine of the upper stage has not yet ignited as the solid kick motors move the lander away from the descent stage.</i>

  <i>With her solid kick motors still burning, Zephyr's ascent engine lights, ready to power the crew towards their home away from home. Crews would describe this maneuver as feeling like "they'd been hit with a pickup truck."</i>

  <i>Her engine lit, Zephyr can continue the climb to orbit, her complex RCS system helping to assume the proper ascent attitude to minimize aerodynamic forces, and enable an efficient trajectory.</i>

  <i>Pushing ever closer to orbit, the ascent stage assumes a horizontal profile. The single LE-57M has to throttle carefully during this segment of flight to ensure G loading on the crew remains comfortable, while still enabling successful orbital insertion.</i>

  <i>With weight at a premium, the choice to use solar arrays over fuel cells was ultimately deemed the right one. With the craft safely in orbit, the rather diminutive remains of Zephyr can begin a series of phasing burns to link up with the MTV-Base Station complex.</i>

  <i>In a combined effort, the MTV-Base Station complex and Zephyr begin to set themselves up for docking. The orbital crew would perform a visual inspection of the ascent stage at this time, looking for any damage that the vehicle may have incurred.</i>

  <i>Now only feet away, with the Soft Capture Ring extended, the crew of Olympus 3 can prepare to embrace their colleagues once more. The loiter in Mars orbit still remains, but soon, the crew can look forward to a homecoming unlike anything in history on their home planet.</i>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Good morning everyone!, I'm super jazzed to get this chapter out for you this week, where we're going to be picking up the pace of operations, and start to fly further and faster. This week, we're going to take a look at the tail end of Olympus 3, the start of Olympus 4, and the future of operations in LEO. The year 1998 is a big one for spaceflight, and we're really starting to pick up the pace of our story. I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PZerg5" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Zarbon</a>, who's artistic vision literally knows no bounds. They have once again shown that the sky is no longer the limit, and the dreams of humanity on Mars are close to reality in this timeline. Without further ado, let's get into it!</span></p>
