  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">T</span><span class="calibre6">he new millennium had finally come, and across the global space industry, things were proceeding at a record pace. Odyssey’s expansion into a fully fledged laboratory had been monumental to see, and much of the work being done on station was in support of life on Earth and in space. The crews of the station would often remark at her creature comforts, and delight in the endless myriad of tasks that the station mission planners had for them. Onboard the station, and on the ground, preparations were underway for the debut of a new series of cargo systems: the Boeing Commercial Space <i>Pegasus</i>, based off of their formerly clandestine Transatmospheric Vehicle, and the upcoming Automated Transfer Vehicle, destined to debut on Ariane V in the next few years. <i>Pegasus</i> would be the first of these flights to debut, in its new uncrewed configuration, delivering 8 tons of cargo to the station. Staged from a newly constructed hangar and maintenance center off of the Kennedy Space Center’s Shuttle Landing Facility, the vehicle soared east like something out of a science fiction film, the orbiter slung underneath it. Crowds had gathered from all over the country to view this magnificent beast rise from the runway, soaring into the crisp skies with its two crewmen onboard the carrier aircraft. After launch, there was not much to do except file out, back to their cars, and hope that the long range cameras would provide something good. The carrier aircraft would begin to climb under the power of its jet engines, before its single SSME-150 would ignite, lofting the craft further into the atmosphere on a tail of burning hydrogen. Soon, the SSME 150 of the orbiter would ignite, and the two vehicles would separate, the carrier aircraft performing the parabolic maneuver required to bring it back towards the landing site, while <i>Excalibur</i> powered on to orbit. The vehicle would find itself no longer held by the rigid tensions of the Earth’s atmosphere, and could shut down her engines and she slipped into orbit. Now, the chase towards Odyssey could begin. The first sighting of the craft by the Odyssey crew was about 2 days after launch, as the glint of her payload bay doors reflected sunlight. The vehicle would come to rest at the lower port on Odyssey, and the crew could begin to unpack the large cargo volume carried onboard. As the orbiter departed after two weeks on orbit, the crews on the ground and on Odyssey looked forward to a future in which perhaps 50% of future station resupply was handled by a fleet of winged vehicles. In many ways, Boeing hoped that Pegasus would assist station operations in a manner complimentary to Shuttle, but it would appear that was not quite the case. Pegasus had proved unwieldy to turn around, and even more difficult handling the payload integration. Crews were used to the long lead times of Shuttle, and would struggle in getting systems ready to fly in time. Instead of the 12 hour launch readiness promised by the original TAV concepts, it looked more along the lines of months of lead time. The Carrier Aircraft, <i>Champion</i>, would suffer from notorious teething problems, leading ultimately to the vehicle to be scheduled for flight only twice a year, as a result of necessary downtime to inspect and repair both components of the system after flights. It was, in some ways, a let down for the Odyssey operations crew, and even more so for Boeing Commercial Space. <i>Pegasus</i> would soon be joined in orbit by supplementary American spacecraft, the Orbital Sciences Cygnus was projected to begin flying by 2005 on the upcoming Atlas NG, in support roles for both Odyssey and MTV preparation for Olympus operations.</span></p>

  <i>Hera's arrival at Venus, to begin a 30 day "fast stay" to investigate the stranger of Earth's neighbor planets. Her immediate priority upon arrival at Venus would be the deployment of the various sub-probes carried onboard.</i>
</span></p>

  <br/> 

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
Venus loomed large in the windows of <i>Hera</i> as she sat in orbit of the planet, taking in the sweeping vistas of this alien world. Her transit had been quick compared to that of a Mars flight, and the crew spent most of their time performing observations of solar phenomenon. The smaller crew had done well on their outbound transit, and orbital insertion around the veiled planet had gone according to plan, separating the first two drop tanks, leaving the remaining two for departure back towards Earth. The planet sat as an eerily featureless orb in their windows, with the occasional aurora and flash of lightning greeting them as they passed to the planet’s night side. <i>Hera’s</i> crew would marvel at the world before them, and at the same time, feel moderately underwhelmed. The atmosphere of Venus would completely obscure their view, but they knew that the surface would not evade them for long. While not as exciting as Olympus 3, the crew would begin to deploy the series of probes meant to examine the origins of the planet and find out if the supporting chemistry for life was there. Venera C1 would be the first probe deployed from <i>Hera</i>, and the crew would watch as the probe streaked through the planet’s atmosphere, its instruments soon revealed after the jettison of the aeroshell and descent to the surface. VISAGE and CLUE would soon follow, streaking into orbit and the atmosphere, setting up a network of monitoring that would enable further discovery for many years to come. As soon as the crew had gotten comfortable in orbit around Venus, the return window for Earth would open and the six person crew would cast off again, expending their second set of drop tanks as they escaped the pull of the veiled planet. For some within the Human Spaceflight Office, the 30 days they had spent at Venus had not been enough, and some argued for a complementary program to Olympus, dedicated to Venus using a concept known only as HAVOC. HAVOC would add a human element to the exploration of the planet, sending crew on a wild ride through the atmosphere in an aeroshell, and exploring the planet in a dirigible. It was considered by many in the scientific community as, arguably, completely and utterly insane. Alas, the focus of human exploration for now would remain firmly on Mars, and as the crew of Olympus 5V returned home, they would once again encounter a world filled with color and vibrance. Now, only Olympus 4 remained in deep space, but it too would soon complete the long journey home before the year was out.</span></p>

  <i>MSAV "Corvus" prepares to make her descent to the Martian Surface with Commander Teller, Pilot Anastasia Fyodorova and Mission Specialists Takeshi Takeda and Dr. Gabriel Herald, for Olympus 4's rotation on the surface.</i>
</span></p>

  <br/> 

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
The surface sortie of Olympus 4 had been one of pushing boundaries, and improving on the lessons learned from Olympus 3. Descent had been one of the areas of great improvement, as Commander Teller furiously studied the notes made by Commander Douglass regarding entry descent and landing protocol. The issues during descent had been problematic to say the least, but pre-launch work on the MSAV of Olympus 4 had enabled an even smoother EDL sequence, and soon Teller, Fyodorova, Takeda and Herald would become the second crew to set foot on the planet Mars. The four crew members broke the record set by Olympus 3 on the surface, for a grand total of 47 days, which remains the longest unassisted surface sortie by an MSAV. The crew would assemble their own rover, and scuttle around the dusty plains of Isdis Planitia, searching for clues that could help explain the planet’s past. The American, Russian and Japanese crew members on the landing team would work together to scour their landing site, and sites of interest, for clues about the history of water and microbiology, as well as setting up a surface station. One of the most important observations of the mission was the observation of carbon dioxide frost, collecting along the surfaces of the lander descent stage, gave some indication that seasonal change was in fact in play on the planet’s surface. Mars had active weather, just like the homeworld. The mission team was overjoyed, and already the next wave of experiments to be sent to the planet was under review. Learning from their previous endeavors, the distance from the lander was pushed to 17 miles, allowing the crew to sample previously unknown areas. At the end of their sortie, they returned to <i>Corvus</i>, and would make the climb into orbit to rendezvous with the waiting fleet, eager to begin the long journey home, and be part of something historic. As the crew completed their transit, they reflected on their position as the second human crew on the Martian surface. While it had been a bit of a sting to immediately follow in the footsteps of the first human landing crew, they had done a good deal of work. Their ambitions were record setting, longest independent surface stay, longest traverse, and most scientific experiments deployed by a surface based EVA. To some, it may seem like a fairly innocuous position, a crew no one would remember on a mission that became commonplace, but these were merely the first steps into a much larger world. A foothold for humanity, learning to live and work off the land as they explored the planet. The Journey home was a long one, as was their outbound cruise, but the reception aboard Intrepid in the mid spring would make all of their efforts worth it. Now, as the Earth’s gravity well would once again embrace them, the crew could look forward to future expansion and upgrades to Olympus’ capability.<br>
<br>
As part of Olympus operations, mission planners had looked to increase the overall time on Mars’ surface, to enable maximum scientific return. Getting all 8 crew members of an Olympus mission to the surface would also enable some recovery from the punishing effects of microgravity. In order to do this, two steps would have to be taken. The first would be advanced prestaging; like the logistics landers before them, these new modules would enable even greater cargo prepositioning on the surface. They were nearly identical, and derived from the Multi Purpose Logistics Modules that had seen considerable flight time to Odyssey, as well as in preparing the MTVs for departure. These vehicles would also be equipped with a robust entry descent and landing system, building off of the success of the landing and wayfinding technology incorporated on the Zephyr class MSAV. They would be helped to the surface by an aeroshell and landing skycrane, which would then deploy ruggedized wheels to enable docking to the landed and vented descent stage of the MSAV. This new stage would have special ports to allow these modules to plug in, and assist the crew in setting up a permanent base of operations for the 500 days they’d remain on the surface. This would enable the crew of future Olympus missions to remain on the surface for far longer. The second step would be the incorporation of a new upper stage with Jupiter-OPAV, the Boeing built Phaeton. Phaeton would be the key, enabling much larger cargo to be carried to the surface of the Red Planet, drastically improving the performance of the system. Two new orbiters would also be dispatched to join the fleet around the Red Planet, launched onboard Delta IIIs. The Solar Biological System, or SBS 1 and 2, would assist the ASTER program in monitoring solar weather around the planet. However, the mission would not be entirely successful. 4 months into their cruise, SBS 2 would enter a tumble, and lose its ability to point its solar panels at the sun. In a desperate attempt to recontact it, the Deep Space Network would transmit line after line of code, anxious to see the orbiter right itself, but there was no such luck. The probe had been lost to the sifting sands of interplanetary space, consumed by the great darkness. SBS 1 would arrive at Mars and settle into a comfortable elliptical orbit, ready to begin measuring the impact of cosmic and solar winds on the red sands below. Some of the mission scientists back on Earth could not help but wonder if the probe longed for its twin, no doubt slingshotting into heliocentric space by now. </span></p>

  <i>Olympus 6's mission patch, the first mission to leave for Mars in the new millennium. The design language of the patch represented a modern and refreshed take on mission iconography, and was an instant favorite among patch collectors.</i>
</span></p>

  <br/> 

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
The buildup and aggregation period around Olympus 6 would see one of the largest fleets depart for Mars in the entire history of the Olympus program. Some of the first launches in preparation for this mission would be the fueling tankers, lofted by the four Jupiter OPAV vehicles within NASA’s fleet, as well as demoing refueling capabilities from European and Japanese partners, launching smaller but still highly capable vehicles to rendezvous with and fuel the transfer elements and MTV. Olympus 6 would be <i>Minerva’s</i> second flight to the Red Planet, an achievement not even considered during the Apollo-era of Mars planning. The first departure of the window would be the twin Augmentation Landers for Olympus 7, dispatching well ahead of the Olympus 6 fleet in preparation for the planned longer stays on the planet’s surface. These two modules, with their beefed up aeroshells and positioning systems, would depart for Mars, ready to debut their experimental skycrane landing system. The twin modules, nicknamed “Bert” and “Ernie”, would soon be away, and the crew of Olympus 6 would get ready to ride Intrepid into orbit. Commanding this mission would be the UK’s Sharon Kensworth, a veteran of flights to Odyssey and Zarya, and commander of the latter station. She would be the second woman to command an Olympus mission, and the first commander not from the US. Joining her would be MTV Pilot Frederick “Fred” Williams, a NASA astronaut and two time shuttle pilot. The mission’s flight surgeon would be an Olympus 1 veteran, Doctor Yevgeniy Volkov, once again boarding Minerva for a flight into the unknown. The Mission Specialists consisted of a diverse and international crew; Maria Di Firenze of Italy, Dr. Richard Trinh of NASA, Germany’s Vance Detrik, Japan’s Akihiro Matsumoto and Kayla St. John of Australia. After a flawless ascent into orbit, they would soon come to port at <i>Minerva’s</i> forward docking port, and their support crew would help them to load the last of the cargo they required into the fleet leading spacecraft. Their lander, <i>Draco</i>, had just finished fueling operations, and stood ready to bring the great fleet onwards to Mars. As the time for their own departure arrived, <i>Intrepid</i> would undock and return home, wishing the 6th Olympus crew well as they sunk into the atmosphere once again. The CDAs on the Transfer Element, as well as on <i>Minerva</i> would move into place, pushing the final elements of the Martian fleet onwards, ringing in the first year of the new millennium as one of discovery and grand voyages. Soon, when the conclusion of Olympus 6 would come, the age of Flags and Footprints on Mars would end, and the start of permanent operations on the planet would commence, setting up for the future of exploration across the Solar System. </span></p>
