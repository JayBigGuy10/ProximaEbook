  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6"><b>John F Kennedy International Airport<br>
Queens - New York City<br>
12:20 am Local Time</b><br>
<br>
"Kennedy Tower, Kennedy Tower, this is the Pentagon, we need you to do a ground stop on everything, clear the air space." <br>
<br>
“This is Kennedy Tower, say again?”<br>
<br>
“I need you to issue a ground stop and divert everything away from the airport, clear every runway. Get every emergency vehicle ready, you need to do this as soon as possible!”<br>
<br>
"We can't do that, we have flights coming in from Europe, I have planes on final - it's the middle of the goddamn evening!" <br>
<br>
"I don't care what you do or where you send them - those flights need to be somewhere else. Divert them to Newark. We require the whole airfield, top priority - national security priority”<br>
<br>
"What could you possibly have coming for us?" <br>
<br>
"Venturestar."<br>
<br>
“Jesus, that shuttle thing?”<br>
<br>
“That’s affirm, Kennedy.”<br>
<br>
“Kennedy, are you still there?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, just, hold on a second…”<br>
<br>
“We’re kind of on a tight schedule.”<br>
<br>
“…. Roger that, moving into emergency procedures, patch us in with your folks in control, how long do we have?”<br>
<br>
“About 15 minutes, Kennedy Tower.”<br>
<br>
“Right. I’m gonna need individual controllers to handle flights, call Newark!”<br>
<br>
“Patching you to the Venturestar folks now…”<br>
<br>
“Alright folks listen up, we have a spacecraft that’s gonna make use of our runway facilities this evening, I need the ground foamed and ready, emergency crews standing by, who am I talking to?”<br>
<br>
“This is Edwards - Venturestar control”<br>
<br>
“Hiya, I’m Steve. I'll be talking you in today. Can you give me a status of the aircraft-er, spacecraft, Edwards?”<br>
<br>
“Well, it’s a glider, sir, so we’ll have to get it right. We had an engine pop on ascent, we’ve vented propellant and are moving through our entry interface. Have you ever handled a landing like this before?”<br>
<br>
“Ain’t that a bitch… no I have not.” <br>
<br>

As morning broke over a rather disjointed Kennedy airport, the extent of what had transpired the previous evening was revealed to a dreary New York. Lofting a payload for the DoD, Venturestar <i>Dauntless</i> had passed through the most arduous part of climb, maximum dynamic pressure, when one of the small nozzles on her mighty aerospike engines had ruptured, tearing a not too insignifcant hole in the airframe. The vehicle would shut down its remaining engines, electronics working overtime to calculate how much time in the air it had left, before selecting a runway within their glideslope - New York’s John F. Kennedy airport. The first reports of something being amiss at the airport came from the sounds of the double sonic booms as she entered by night, rattling the windows of Long Islanders. This, however did not rouse them from their beds, the sights and sounds of the city were enough to numb anyone to strange bumps in the night. The next indication that something strange had happened from Twitter, as passengers on ferries headed into the city spotted something… unusual sitting in the EMAS at the end of one of Kennedy’s runways. <i>Dauntless</i>, rather indignantly, sat, unsure firefighters gathering around her to inspect her. Anxious Lockheed engineers would mill about her, remarking at her tires sitting stuck in the arresting system. Military officials had cordoned off the area, her classified payload still stuck inside the bay. Flights landing at the iconic airport were treated to a view of the vehicle, with pilots doing their best to inform passengers of why exactly it was there. Needless to say, Kennedy was in shambles. After two days out in the elements, <i>Dauntless</i> was loaded onto a covered barge, and began the long journey back down to Florida for teardown and inspection. NASA, the primary future customer for Venturestar, would express their concerns. A vehicle, such as this, bearing down on a commercial runway would not necessarily generate good optics for the program. Lockheed did their best to retort, reminding the agency of the importance of vehicle recovery. Day after day of tedious inspection would do some good to comfort NASA, knowing that their teams were on top of the problems. After a final, thorough inspection, the Venturestar fleet would be allowed to proceed towards flight once more, set for their first demonstration flight to Horizon scheduled for next year.  <br>

Four sets of nuclear engines would ignite at Mars, and the fleet could begin their slow burn for arrival. The “15 Armada”, as they’d been dubbed by the press, was now on the final stretch towards, the final few steps before victory on the Red Planet. Firmly in the lead was the crew’s MTV, Selene, as she pressed on towards a rendezvous with the Mars Base Station. The transit had been long, as they had been for missions past, but the crew could not help but rejoice at the sight of the Red Planet, now so large in their window. Next up would be the Foundation Core Module, placed in a lower orbit than the MTV and Base Station to ensure the minimal heating possible on entry. The crew watched and waited, counting down the hours, minutes, and seconds until orbital entry. Capturing around Mars was something of a perfected science now, but for this crew in particular, there was a feeling of nervousness. This was the nexus of settlement on the planet, a permanent foundation for humanity to operate out of. With a cheerful tone from the flight computer, and exhaustion of the Transfer Element, Foundation was in orbit, and the crew could turn their attention to the next two vehicles headed for the planet. Up first was <i>Hydra</i>, the last MSAV vehicle to fly as part of the Olympus program. She bore a special paint scheme, signed by all of those who worked on her, and bearing every patch of the program thus far - including the ill fated Olympus 9. For the crew, it was a bittersweet moment, one of the last great titans of the “Old Way”, a now outdated and outclassed way of doing things. The expendable way. She would capture into a lazy, eccentric orbit, lowering slowly over the coming weeks as the crew prepared for their journey to the surface. On the surface already were the two logistics modules, standard for the conversion of the descent stage into their home away from home - with a twist. These modules would be outfitted with equipment for the base, which was set to touch down nearby only a few days before the crew. Finally, the last components of the fleet would enter orbit, MADV<i> Enterprise</i>, her thermal resistant hull glowing red in the Mars light. Enterprise would spend a good deal of time away from the Base Station itself, doing independent checks, managing boiloff and performing wayfinding activities. After nearly two weeks after the entire fleet had arrived, the Core Module of the base would fire its attitude control engines, and begin the plunge into the atmosphere. The crew onboard the Base Station could only watch as their home on the surface would dip into the wispy clouds of Mars, a turbulent and dusty world awaiting it. Moment by moment, the crew would wait for acquisition of signal, the sign that all had gone to plan. 6 minutes after entry, a tone from the flight computers - the final stage of descent, powered flight, had begun. Grainy footage transmitted from the landing cameras showed the spacecraft slewing over terrain, fighting tooth and nail to get to the landing site. An automated voice would call out the distances, 50… 40… 30… the dust would pick up and swirl around the spacecraft, rapidly pulsing its RCS to keep itself stable. At last, contact light… Humanity’s first home on the Red Planet, now with all of its legs on solid ground.</span></p>

Prep for surface operations hastily followed, and after nearly a month and a half at Mars, the hatches were sealed, and <i>Hydra</i> would undock from its berth, and begin the long fall towards the planet. Under the watchful eye of the Base Station, MTV and a distant <i>Enterprise</i>, <i>Hydra</i> would commit to the landing - Lander Pilot Lance Novak at the controls. Once again, the crew would feel the pull of gravity as the planet wrapped its hands around them, dust starting to scuff the paint. With a jolt, the last ballute to be deployed by a crewed lander for the foreseeable future would be deployed, and the crew would begin to recognize familiar sights on the surface, the maze-like network of Noctis stretching out below them. With a thump, and the spin down of the turbopumps of the engines, the vehicle would come to a stop at last, the last descent carried out by an MSAV vehicle. It was for the crew, a brief moment of triumph, a moment where they could celebrate, before the long road ahead could begin. The first steps of their mission would be to suit up and start the traverse over to the base, a short 1 km walk that would take them to Foundation’s door. The rise of the valley walls in the distance acted as reminder of just how strange and new this location was, smack dab in the middle of some of the most complex and intricate geography on the whole planet. It was almost eerie. As the crew approached, they began to capture the majesty of what lay before them, a new home on the surface of the planet, packaged ever so nicely for them by the kind folks on Earth. Mission Surgeon Misha Petrov quipped, as they began the entry procedure, that “after all this time renting on the surface, it was time to settle down, start a life…” This sense of humor and joy would continue as the days of setup continued, reveling in the sheer amount of space available to the crew. They would soon get to work, hauling the cargo modules over and attaching them to the radial ports of the base, ensuring strong and durable seals as they unpacked their supplies. This was to be the main way of expansion of the base, new cargo resupply modules being repurposed into functional space. While not as spacious as the core, this would act as a solid complement to the sheer volume available to them, with another core sized module projected to be delivered 5 years down the line. On the end of their week of set up, the crew would sit down to a meal, “clinking” their glasses (in this case, pouches of fluid) as they rejoiced in the warmth and comfort of the first home on Mars. “Today,” Aki Onishi, mission geologist remarked, “Is not a day that I as a child or perhaps others saw coming in my life… But here we are, a family together on Mars. To us!” Weeks soon turned into months, and the time for a most crucial test would come. In orbit, a silent leviathan, eyeing the dusty surface of the planet below. <i>Enterprise</i> would finally get her chance to spread her wings. Like a great beast waking from her slumber, her 6 main engines would light once, very briefly, to push the spacecraft out of orbit, lined up with a pre-established landing zone. Inside Foundation’s core module, the dinner table had turned into a command center, with every member of the crew anxiously watching as <i>Enterprise’s</i> skin began to heat. Like the shuttle before her, she would bank with turns, using her high surface area to slow down as much as possible. The atmosphere, once a tenuous force on her body panels, was now thick enough to start to work with, and the spacecraft could re-orient itself for supersonic retropropulsion. With a dramatic pitch up of the nose, the vehicle would point its engines at the surface, arresting their fall. On the surface, the slightest vibration began to register on sensors dotted around the base - <i>Enterprise</i> was announcing her arrival. The first indications of her imminent approach came on the external cameras of the base, a spot moving in the sky. Mission Specialist Emilia Pagani was the first to spot her, sprinting to the window to capture a better view. As she grew closer to the surface, <i>Enterprise’s</i> engines would increase their power, moving ever slower. Soon, nearly a kilometer and a half from the base, she would come to a near hover, lowering her gargantuan and alien frame to the surface. With a cloud of steam and vapor, the vehicle would settle, sitting at rest for the first time since the moments before departure from Earth. On the surface, and back home, crews rejoiced. The age of sustainable human exploration had arrived - in style.      <br>

At Kennedy Space Center, a metamorphosis was taking place. On Pad 41, ACEV <i>Kitty Hawk</i> was being prepared for her debut crewed launch to Horizon, the first demonstration of her capabilities as a crew vehicle, supporting expeditions to the grand complex and later on to Mars. Her rollout had been seamless, and weather was looking solid for the first launch attempt a little over a week from now. But none of that mattered right now - two distinguished veterans were arriving. At 88 years old, John Young had watched it all, first the moon and now on to Mars, and had played his part in building the shuttle program with which the Olympus program had stood tall upon. Now, that program was beginning to wind down - the first step of it beginning this evening. And who better to be there than a man who had been with it from the start, commander of STS-2, and Flight Director on STS-1. A crowd of space enthusiasts had flocked to the Space Coast, eager to catch sight of the first, last landing. <i>Challenger’s</i> final landing. She had been a fleet leader, a constant and steady presence in space. From Skylab to Odyssey to Gateway and Horizon, <i>Challenger</i> had done it all, and Commander Young had been there to bear witness. Before the end of the next two years, the remaining shuttles would slowly be withdrawn from service, performing their final functions as ACEV and Venturestar stood ready to pick up the slack, a testament to lessons learned throughout the program. The evening air was thick, typical of Florida nights, and jets roared overhead as they scanned the skies for<i> Challenger’s</i> arrival. Soon, the double sonic booms would give her away, and Commander Young’s face lit up - just like when he had seen the great machine for the first time. As the vehicle’s main gear would make contact with the runway one final time, and the fleet of vehicles would race to meet her and her crew, Commander Young could breathe a little easier, and reflect on this magnificent machine that sat, finally still before him. <i>Challenger</i> put herself on the line for every crew that followed him, venturing alone into space to blaze a trail that ultimately leads to Mars. At the end though she wasn’t alone. Not like her first foray into the unknown Cradled in her wings was the crew she was always built for. The people she served. The spirit of tomorrow. </span></p>
