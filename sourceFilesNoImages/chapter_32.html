  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">A</span><span class="calibre6">s the lifeboat bobbed in the waves of the Pacific Ocean, and the recovery teams moved to secure it, people all across the world were scrambling to figure out what had gone wrong. The press was overjoyed, with veteran reporters moved to tears as shots of the lifeboat bobbed in the waves. The crew had been plucked out of the water by a Sea King, and placed on the deck where they would be carefully extracted. Commander Douglass had been the first to knock on and press her face against the hatch, and observe the weary crew - separated by glass and metal. The recovery team would pop the hatch, and Anna could not help but cry. They were here, still contained in their spacesuits, but here - bodies wrapped in Kevlar and electronic equipment. She called for them over the roar of prop wash, the cacophony of waves, when she felt it. She felt Ivanov’s hand grasp hers, a silent but welcome hello, a delicate touch in their steel enclosure. The tears would spring back, and she gripped his hand tight, a reminder of terra firma.  As if bodied by the waves below her feet, she was moved away by the recovery team, cracking open the visors of the crew, taking vitals. In an instant it had transformed into a clockwork military operation. Oxygen masks were placed over their faces, and tired eyes met Anna’s. She was no longer the brave commander, but a friend, a friend to guide her own through the most arduous ordeal still to come. One by one, the crew would be pulled from the confined capsule, and hurried down a series of elevators and hallways, leaving Anna on the deck with what remained of the recovery team. It was only then where she realized how tired she was, how beaten by the days of anxiety and dread her body was. It was a feeling she had not felt since her first few hours on the Martian surface. The next few hours were brutal for O9, adjustment to gravity once more, and the nausea that ensued plagued the crew - confining them all to the ship’s medical wing. Taylor was the immediate priority, his sedatives had begun to wear off, and he had been extracted quickly to get him into surgery. The rest of the crew were given fluids, beds, and medical attention, but they were in largely good shape considering the circumstances… But Taylor’s injury hung over them. In each of their minds, the accident rested on their shoulders, a reminder of the trials and tribulations they had endured. Taylor would exit the intensive care unit 7 hours after their splashdown, and would awaken the following day as the USS <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> began to make the journey home to Hawaii. Commander Douglass and Ivanov would sit at his side as he came to, calmly welcoming him back to the world. The impact of gravity was apparent - he was quite weak, but able to recognize where he was: home. Ivanov spoke first, and apologized profusely for his failings throughout the mission. It was clear to Anna that this accident stung, a painful reminder of what had gone wrong. Taylor refused to put him at fault, these risks were known, and he held no grudges against his commander. It was for Ivanov, a moment of healing, a moment to process all of what had happened, and what was still to come - and as the crew recuperated, they could begin to take apart those tumultuous months leading to their recovery.      <br>
<br>
The Olympus Program had effectively ground to a halt, ready to begin the arduous process of assessing the damage. For so many years, a crew had always been preparing in some way shape or form and now… silence. A mission had not been slated to leave in 2007, the time Olympus 9 was supposed to be on the surface, but assembly and outfitting work for <i>Minerva’s</i> rotation on Olympus 10 was underway. Almost overnight, as the crew were flown back to Houston, all work would stop on the program. Odyssey operations would continue, as all EMUs were inspected and certified for flight. An internal review board, comprising the various members of staff for the program, would convene to begin their analysis of the mission. Commander Douglass was seen as an obvious choice, but there were some who would question her appointment - having been so personally involved in the mission. Yevgeniy Volkov, Yume Ueno and Mark Teller, fellow Olympus veterans, would also join the review board, alongside Apollo legend Jim Lovell, as well as NASA, ESA and JAXA representatives. Lovell came as a surprise for many, but those within the agency felt his experience dealing with disasters in deep space would provide valuable insight as to the nature of their ordeal. Representatives from ILC, the manufacturer of the spacesuit, Johnson Space Center, CSA and more would file in as they began the arduous process of review. In past accidents that had occurred in spaceflight, it had almost always been a fault of design, some mechanical accident that had led to the ultimate fate of the crew. But this was far from the case here, the crew were the element that guided the sequence of events. The first series of questions fell to the crew from ILC, and Johnson’s EVA management. Some of the initial moments of investigation would look at Odyssey procedures, where the two spacewalkers had trained, and pondered the possibility of lax safety culture. Mission controllers, reviewing logs, showed that no steps had been skipped in the suit up procedure, that they’d maintained the standards for operation during the EVA, and both Taylor and Small had followed the procedures to the letter. The committee was soon mostly satisfied, and their attention would turn to the suit, the key failure element here. A painful reconstruction of the accident was conducted in a prototype build of a VR setup, simulating to the committee what had taken place. For some, it was too much to handle, the stress of the situation and the sheer disorienting power of the space walk would move some to nausea. It became apparent that, despite what had happened, the suits were safe - but questions about the nature of the accident still remained. The focus turned to Taylor and Small, and whether or not they had mishandled a step in the process. It would be painful, that much was certain, to reconstruct the accident for them. But it was a kind of pain that was necessary to ensure that future missions were safe. The crew would need to be brought in to testify in front of their colleagues, the world eager to know the truth.      <br>
<br>
Three months after the return of the crew of Olympus 9, and the start of the investigation, the 8 crew members filed into the board room, ready to begin answering questions about their journey. Present in the room was the investigative board, several members of Congress, and the families of the astronauts. As they took their seats, Commander Douglass took the time to welcome them, and started the meeting with a message that would ring in their ears for years to come: “Today, we sit in this room together not as interrogator and suspect, but as friends, working to find a solution that will allow us to continue to explore Mars, and unlock humankind’s potential among the cosmos. In spaceflight, no journey is easy, and we must look at the hardships of our journey head on and decide whether or not we are willing to tackle them. You did, you all did. You knew what needed to be done, and for that, I commend you. You are some of the bravest and most daring astronauts I have ever met, and I have never seen a bond as strong as the one present on Olympus 9. When we ask you questions, we intend to do so with the most respect, and hope that you understand that the hard questions exist to get to the bottom of what happened, and ensure it never happens again. Let’s get to work.” The binders would be cracked, and the crew would find themselves reviewing the procedures that they had worked through all those months ago, reliving the moments that would make them one of the most famous, if not infamous crews, in the history of the Olympus program. They would spend the first few weeks of the crew interviews tackling the chain of command, which immediately disturbed Ivanov. His chain of command disruption, as the committee came to call it, was deeply scrutinized, and his moments of weakness replayed… a painful reminder to say the least. The EVA would be next, having been poured over for weeks in previous testimony. Taylor and Small would walk the committee through the details of the EVA, reviewing every step in careful detail. The committee would soon learn of the horrors endured in the immediate aftermath as the crew worked to describe them, and the sounds of their wounded spaceship would once again fill the ears of the crew as they reviewed the flight data recorder. <i>Hera</i> was dying, before their very eyes, again. For Delon and Ayase, this would prove too much, and the two would excuse themselves for a brief recess to compose themselves. The investigation was arduous, but it was reiterating what many had known throughout the entire process - this was a human accident, not some great technical failure… but the process of review still remained. <br>
<br>
As the crew returned to continue testifying, it was clear a rift was developing between the investigative team and the crew. Tensions were flaring, evidenced by the reddening of Ivanov’s face and the sinking of Delon into his chair. The committee couldn’t seem to understand, why hadn’t they followed the procedure as accurately as possible, why hadn’t they stowed the arm and performed the abort? Why did they not stick to the schedule of what should have happened if an abort had been commanded, with no call to mission control? For hours and hours, these questions persisted, and the teams seemed to dance in circles, until finally, Taylor had enough. Standing before the committee, he would give the most important address of the entire investigation: “Ladies and Gentlemen… Sorry… I cannot sit here in good faith and watch you interrogate my crew members as to their decision making, our decision making. What happened out there was bad, I was injured and in need, and when you see a crewmember in need, you do everything you can to ensure that they get help. Without the actions of every single crew member on that flight, I would be a lot worse off… Never before in human spaceflight has such a specific window for an abort been required, have so many things gone so… awry. We didn’t stow the arm because there wasn’t time, not because we were intentionally taking risks, but because my crewmates were working to ensure that I didn’t lose more than my hand out there. The fact of the matter is this - we put <i>Hera</i> through more than she was ever designed for, she served us well, and all components of the ship functioned as they should. If you wanna pin the blame on anyone for not ejecting the arm, it's me, I will accept responsibility for it. But they did their best to get us home, the rest of the crew did… and I’m standing here in front of you. So ladies and gentlemen, take it from me when I tell you that we did our jobs, Olympus is and has been a program with its understood risk, but I, and the rest of the astronaut corps, feel comfortable proceeding.” In stunned silence, the committee would watch as Taylor made his way back to his seat, embracing his colleagues. The Olympus 9 Accident Investigation board would spend an additional two weeks deliberating, moved fundamentally by the testimony of Chris Taylor. The committee would take another recess, before announcing the results of their findings the following week. <br>
<br>
The official findings and recommendations would be released in the following weeks, clearing the way for the future of the Olympus program to proceed with revised guidelines. They found that the crew of Olympus 9 acted in the interest of mission safety, and did not put any crew members at risk - despite the obvious disconnect from Mission Control. The EMU suits were cleared to proceed for use on both LEO and BLEO missions, with ILC providing additional safety steps for the operation of the suits in deep space, coordinating with NASA Johnson and ESA on new operational procedures for any potential repair away from heart. The most comprehensive item review would be the flight computer - a relic of the program’s origins in the late 80s. The two remaining MTVs would, as soon as they were able, be refit with a new computer system, the General Autonomous Information Assistant, or GAIA. GAIA would enable more independence from Mission Control, and allow for the crew to not get tied down with procedure in the face of light delay. The system would act as an autonomous aid, providing real time status of systems, trajectory maps and more. This would remove the need for uplinked mission packets about abort parameters, and provide all essential information to the crew should they need it. As the investigation wound down, its participants took a solid look at the nature of the incident. So many failures before had been technical, Apollo 1 and 13, the loss of <i>Valiant</i>, but this was a whole different ball game. A human accident had so many more factors to contend with, psychological and physical stress, environmental hazards and more - and the Olympus 9 accident had tested the resilience of the Human Spaceflight Office. As for the crew? Well, they were still eligible to fly on another rotation, but it soon became apparent that some of them wanted no part. Ivanov would take a leave of absence, and Weir would outright resign. The remaining crew members would find themselves in office jobs, stepping out of the spotlight of their accident for the foreseeable future. The Olympus Program had survived its first accident, with no loss of life, something mission planners constantly had looming in the back of their mind throughout the journey home. It now looked to the future, one where perhaps newer, safer mission design could prevent something like this from ever happening again. This was, the report noted, an accident unlike any seen before: it was not a technical failure, rather, a technical success. The vehicles that the crew put their trust in functioned as was expected of them too, and the crew acted to ensure the safety of the entire mission. This was an unfortunate setback, to lose one of their fleet, but it served to validate the design of the spacecraft as a whole. The commission into the accident would dismiss 5 months before the next Martian window, just enough time to begin the campaign to get the next Olympus rotation ready. It would be a tight window to meet, but the partnership felt comfortable enough with proceeding to move forward once again.      <br>
<br>
In the summer of 2008, a streak of light pierced the darkness of the summer night - not a lightning bolt so typical of Florida summers, but <i>Challenger</i>, carrying with her the first module of a new breed of space station, Gateway. Thundering into the night, the veteran orbiter would head for her destination orbit, a comfortable 31 degree inclination. The station, the first new station as part of NASA’s plan to revolutionize the utilization of Low Earth Orbit, would quickly grow into a prime destination in orbit. Spacecraft headed to distant worlds, MTVs, and many more great machines would be serviced here - building on years of knowledge of orbital construction. The age of many stations, little oases in orbit, was well and truly here - a diverse ecosystem of purpose built islands among the stars. A flawless orbital insertion in orbital sunrise greeted the crew of the orbiter as they configured it for flight. Moving carefully, the crew onboard <i>Challenger</i> would maneuver the orbiter’s robotic arm to extract the module, and stack it atop the docking adapter in the payload bay. The module would extend its keep alive solar arrays, and prepare for the next phase of assembly, stacking of the Interim Propulsion Module. This module, based on designs for space tugs that came about during the late 70s, would not be a permanent fixture onboard Gateway. Rather, it would merely support the station temporarily before the Hall Effect Power and Propulsion Module or HePPM would be delivered on the next flight. As carefully as they extracted the core module, the IPM was moved to the rear of the station and stacked, and the crews worked to prime the onboard systems. A snag was hit early on when an antenna onboard the station failed to deploy, limiting communications to the TDRSS network. This would be quickly resolved as the crews managed the systems, eventually achieving connectivity with the network. As the flight progressed, the crew would work on outfitting the various features, including preparing the hatches and mounting points for the upcoming robotic arm. After 12 days at the nascent complex, <i>Challenger</i> would depart, leaving behind a station ready for the future of humanity in space, one no longer limited by what their carrier rockets could bring with them. Early operational plans looked at servicing the Hubble Space Telescope via the new docking adapters and robotic arms due to be positioned on the station, but it would soon become clear that there would be an even bigger priority, handling construction as NASA and their partners looked to construct a replacement MTV after the loss of <i>Hera.</i>    <br>
<br>
With the Olympus program once again taking steps towards the unknown, it was clear that the immediate priority after the return to flight would be the construction of a new MTV to replace<i> Hera</i>. Her sacrifice, for all of those who built her, assembled her in space, manufactured components, and more was deeply felt across the industry, and amateur astronomers across the world trained their aided eyes towards a point of light that might reveal her fate. The Olympus Partners, for now, felt comfortable enough proceeding with the two remaining MTVs, as designs and potential updates and plans for the next MTV circulated. As the crew of Olympus 10 transferred to <i>Minerva</i>, there was an air of uncertainty. Their mission, a slightly revised form of the Follow the Water plan laid out all those years ago, seemed overly cautious, and rightfully so. Their original plan, to launch a new lander, had been revised to rendezvous with the lander originally slated for Olympus 9, <i>Orion</i>, which had spent time loitering at the Base Station. Their 8 person crew, in many ways, would test out some of the new procedures, and the new payload rack for GAIA which had been brought up before their flight had left Earth orbit. Their commander, Martin Conway of NASA, would offer these words for the world to hear as they prepared to light <i>Minerva’s</i> engines: “We, the crew of Olympus 10, represent a step back. We represent a cautious moment, a moment of concern, and a moment of optimism that we can once again go forward into the unknown in peace and unity for all mankind. As I look at my crew, sitting here with me, I see the faces of an international team ready to do things that 50 years ago may have been considered impossible, and I am ready to turn that impossibility into a reality. The ordeal that the crew of OIympus 9 endured is a testament to mind and body, of human resolve, that I do not think has been seen since the Age of Exploration. I hope one day to be as brave as them, and do them proud as we conduct our work on the Martian surface. There is a moment, as we go forward, where we must remember the sacrifices that our fellow crewmates made, and as we head towards the next decade of Martian exploration, do our best to honor their sacrifice. We will follow the footsteps of those who came before us, and we will use our knowledge to follow the water and pull back the curtain on Mars’ mysteries. We are ready to head, once more, into the breach.” As the crew of Olympus 10 would head to Mars, riding the power of their Valkyrie engines, planning work on the ground for the fifth MTV, <i>Selene</i>, could begin. </span></p>
