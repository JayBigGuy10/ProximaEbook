  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">A</span><span class="calibre6">n explosion had happened somewhere on the moon, and all of the international astronomy community knew it. The night of April 15th, 2002 had been quiet for telescopes all across the world, broken only by an alarm from asteroid detection arrays, something was crossing into the Earth-Moon system, and fast. Electronic eyes all across the planet turned to attempt to catch the object and as it streaked through the gravity well of the Earth and Moon. It was just past four in the morning when the alarm was triggered, and the subsequent movement of the telescopes was not quite fast enough to capture what would come next. A plume of dust, rising off of the lunar surface, would glint and tumble, and the astronomers on the ground would take stock of what they had just witnessed: the largest impact directly observed on a planetary body. The next few hours saw arrays across the world scan the skies, looking for any potential impactors that could follow along, and objects on trajectories that would impact Earth. Their search found no additional hazards, and residual impacts continued on the lunar surface as debris from the event found its way to the surface. The Apollo seismic experiments, long dormant, would continue to pick up impact after impact as the lunar surface would be bombarded with debris. The rest of the world would react in shock: something had truly snuck up on the Earth-Moon system, and packed the kinetic power of thousands of pounds of TNT. To those in astronomy, this had been something on the radar for a long time, and close calls had been reported on before. Congress would immediately convene, to begin to take steps on advising NASA on their next steps [1]. Once the world could begin to communicate on the issue, telescopes all over began to scan the lunar surface. The impactor had struck Mare Imbrium, and as the dust began to settle, the extent of the damage became clear. A massive scar now lurked on the lunar surface, a menacing reminder of the power the solar system contained.  Several years ago, an asteroid hunting program had been stripped from the budget in order to keep Olympus on track when it looked as though the original nuclear engines were struggling. Now, in light of this event, many felt that a restart of an international effort could be useful in underscoring the importance of planetary defense. NASA and their partners would soon begin to get to work on a new wave of mission plans, designed to help ensure safety for planet Earth, while doing cutting edge research to understand the origins of our solar system.</span></p>

The first probe launched as part of the newly formed Planetary Defense Program was not originally assembled and planned for it. JPL had been planning a study of the short period comet Encke for some time, and now the Cometary System Analysis Mission, or CSAM, was being prepared for launch aboard a Delta III. The probe consisted of multiple parts - the Orbiter, which would act as a mothership for the variety of internationally provided microprobes. The CSAM Orbiter would hang back from comet Encke as the variety of other, smaller probes got closer to the relatively active icy world, and would act as a relay [2]. The first microprobe would be PlumeDiver, a shielded spacecraft that would dive into the cometary tail to collect images of the close up plume action. The probe was a CalTech build, and contained a chip containing the names of all who worked on her. The next probe was the Experimental Comet Rover, a small cold gas powered vehicle that aimed to bounce around the low gravity world and discover what the system had to offer. The probe would depart from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and soon be on its way to the icy world, ready to help humanity categorize these types of small bodies. On Earth, the formation of the new Planetary Defense Program would soon bear fruit - signatures would come from ESA, NASDA and CSA, reaffirming their commitment to defense of Planet Earth. The program would soon begin to look at early plans for an interceptor mission, and categorization missions that could enable early detection and test deflection technologies as part of an effort to keep the planet safe. One such concept involved targeting a binary asteroid and quite literally smacking the probe into it to test deflection techniques, a strategy not yet before tried. Whatever the final outcome was in the Planetary Defense Program, the people of Earth were determined to protect their home world, whatever it took.</span></p>

In LEO, a plethora of activity was taking place. Despite the resonating uneasiness that the Impactor Event on the moon had generated, work on Olympus and other activities would continue. Odyssey had been one of the first assets in space to turn their attention to the moon - human eyes. Images from the station would circulate around the world, and help scientists better categorize what exactly had happened. The Russian station Zarya had long performed its function as a testing ground for activity that would later be carried out in deep space. Cobbled together from components originally planned for a station known as Mir, but would form the backbone for training astronauts in how to live and work in space for extended periods of time. While not as expansive as the facilities onboard Odyssey, the station would prove vital in training astronauts and cosmonauts with how to deal with problems. The European Space Agency had long wanted to extend their cooperation with the former Soviet Union, as they retained a special closeness in their relationship since the days of the Paris Agreement. In the spring of 1999, European representatives had approached their Russian colleagues about a proposal, and laid out a roadmap for the future of Russo-European relationships in space. The Russians, having not participated in Odyssey, were eager to expand their relationships and build bridges with the West. Europe, looking also for additional research opportunities, would soon reach a deal. Their plan was to launch a European built node with an additional PMA and Russian probe and drogue port onboard an Ariane V, and dock it to the station, setting up for the future expansion of the station, and eventual servicing by an upgraded Liberté vehicle. On August 1, 2002, the Donatello node was lofted to the station by an Ariane V, along with a new robotic element - the European Robotic Manipulator. The module would come to rest at Zarya, and the small tug that shepherded it there would commit to a deorbit burn. Work would start almost immediately on commissioning the module, with the Russo-French crew on station working to outfit the new module. Initial work would be done to establish connections to the module, and secure it for long term station operations. The next task, and arguably the most arduous one, would be the activation of the station’s robotic arm. The arm, derived from one of Odyssey’s Canadarms, would be used to support new modules and logistics vehicles to the station, and help the station prepare for potential expansion. One such idea called for a new Russian deep space telescope to be staged out of Zarya, and brought in to service it once every four years. This, however, would not come to fruition, at least at Zarya, as the station’s age and relatively limited docking space would limit them from fully expanding the station into as strong of an aggregation platform as her larger sister - Odyssey.</span></p>

Olympus 7’s crew would be lofted into space close to the end of the year, as the window for Mars opened. The first 8 person landing, they had a considerable amount on their minds as they prepared for their departure. The successful return of Olympus 6 earlier in the year, the last short stay mission of the program as a whole, had given the crew much hope for a successful mission to the Red Planet. After <i>Draco’s</i> successful operation on the surface and the loiter in Martian orbit, the crew of Minerva had made the voyage back to Earth, weathering a minor solar flare on the way. Their quick thinking ensured their safety, and proved that the storm shelter onboard the MTVs was up to snuff. <i>Minerva</i> had proved herself as the fleet leader, with not a single problem cropping up on the cruise back. During their return to Planet Earth, they were fortunate enough to conduct a flyby of the Moon, a unique opportunity to image the impact site that had been generated by the bolide that had struck it. What the crew found was shocking - Mare Imbrium was changed, a deep scar exposed the dark volcanic rock below the surface, and a new layer of dust had settled around the planet. Images from the mission, as well as orbiters around the moon confirmed the settlement of a layer of regolith in new areas. The crew, under Commander Sharon Kensworth’s command, completed Earth orbit insertion and were retrieved by <i>Intrepid</i>, bringing with them samples and experiments that had been conducted during their stay in space. On Earth, upgrades to the MSAV system, designed to enable wet workshop operations of the second stage, had proceeded on schedule, enabling the Olympus planners to confidently fly Olympus 7 as the first long stay mission. The cargo landers for Olympus 8 had also been dispatched, launching on dual Jupiter-OPAV flights towards the landing site at Jezero. The mission’s lander, <i>Scorpius</i>, sat attached to its transfer stage alongside <i>Hera</i> - recently out of a refit from her mission to Venus. The mission’s commander, NASA’s Michael “Mitch” Diaz, had been with the agency since missions to Mars had begun, and now had the opportunity to command a whole new breed of mission. The MTV pilot, NASA’s Gabriel Foust, had taken advantage of new virtual reality training to prepare for operations onboard <i>Hera</i>, and upgrades during her refit would allow for uncrewed operations in Martian orbit. The mission’s surgeon, Dr. Luca Bianchi from ESA, would finally get to put his training to the test, having practiced wilderness medicine north of the Arctic Circle. Russia’s Tekla Soloyova and ESA’s Catarina Hammond of the Netherlands were the mission’s Hab technicians, responsible for assembling and integrating the two logistics modules already on the surface. John Ryder of NASA, Misa Takahashi of NASDA and Mikkel Fischer of ESA would be in charge of surface operations once the crew had landed and set up their home away from home.<br>
<br>
As the crew got their ship ready in orbit, and <i>Intrepid</i> backed away for departure, the time for analysis came. The crew knew that a cable had struck their habitat Augmentation Module, and the pressure vessel’s condition was uncertain. The last measurements had indicated all was well, but the crew would not be able to assess the situation until they got to the surface and investigated. In the event that the pressure vessel had indeed been compromised, they would board their lander and return to the Base Station-MTV complex, and perform their mission at Mars in orbit. It would be, to many, a great disappointment - knowing they had come so close to making great strides on the planet only to be limited by technical issues. Nevertheless, contingency plans were well underway by the time their lander had committed to departure. Lighting the single Valkyrie on her transfer stage, <i>Scorpius</i> would cast herself towards the red planet, with the crew of <i>Hera</i> preparing to do the same. Strapping into their seats, the crew would tackle their pre-departure checklist, aligning the moving parts on the outside of the spacecraft. Soon, they would be go to commit to trans Mars injection, propelling the crew towards a future on the Red Planet. As the engines lit, and the crew felt the force of the three Valkyrie engines pushing them into their seat, the geiger counter ticking away. There had been some discussion of removing the geiger counter on upcoming flights, now that the safety of the MTVs had been accurately assessed, but crews had protested, citing their psychological benefits. The tick of the geiger counter would fade as the engines shut down, and the crew could begin their coast phase. Much as the crew of Olympus 6 had, the crew of Olympus 7 would take the time to observe the moon, and take in the majesty of Earth’s celestial neighbor, still freshly scarred from impact. It was a solemn sight for the crew, something seemingly so cosmically massive taking such a blow, but it underscored for the crew the reasons why they would push so hard to go to Mars, to go to and discover what lay out there, and what other threats Earth faced.</span></p>

The first two months of cruise were uneventful, and communications with Earth would soon drop to uplink and downlink. The crew would take this time to relax, and prepare themselves for the coming expedition. Routine governed the crew’s day to day, and <i>Hera</i> threw no major issues their way during the outbound journey. Careful choreography was the name of the game, ensuring that the crew would not be  On flight day 90, as the crew were getting ready to eat dinner, an alarm on the flight deck sounded: FLARE WARNING. SHELTER IMMEDIATELY. The crew left their dinner, and worked to prepare the cabin for shielding operations. Learning from experience on Olympus 6, which was a much smaller flare, the crew donned their dosimeters, shielded vests, and moved into the storm shelter, a water shielded compartment in the aft of the spacecraft, and positioned the vehicle so the hydrogen tanks of the vehicle could provide some protection. Donning their radiation vests, the crew sealed the compartment, getting cozy with one another as the klaxon would continue for another 40 minutes. The alarm finally would come to a stop, and the crew could exit their cocoon and begin to inspect their ship, and get them back in the correct attitude for cruise. The storm on Olympus 6 had been nowhere near this intense, and the crew began to take stock of the damage done. Communications had survived, and Hera was still transmitting health data, but internal electronics had been damaged. Several experiment racks were completely offline, and personal equipment was fried. The radiation hardening of the ship had helped somewhat, but personal computers would need to be taken apart and replaced, and electronic equipment would need to be reset. Over the next few days, the crew would work to slowly reboot the ship’s systems, and figure out the status of their lander, Scorpius. The MSAV vehicle would have assumed the same attitude, and a general health check showed that <i>Scorpius</i> was in good condition to continue the mission. For now, they were safe - able to proceed with their mission and make the landing site, but it served as a reminder to the harsh reality of space as a whole. The crew were shaken, understandably so, and the uncertainty of their habitat’s condition on the surface sat in the back of their minds - but they were on their way, determined to finish their task at hand and do what they needed to do.<br>
