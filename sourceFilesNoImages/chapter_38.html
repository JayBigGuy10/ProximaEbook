  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">T</span><span class="calibre6">he journey of Olympus 12 had, unfortunately, come to an end, and the crew of the historic mission would find themselves returning home to much fanfare in 2014. Their return onboard Intrepid, touching down in the humid Florida night, would be a welcome sight, and as they exited the orbiter to once again be with their loved ones, work would proceed on orbit as Gateway moved to dock with<i> Selene</i>, ready to provide necessary servicing and re-aggregation of drop tanks. Work with the station as a platform would prove immensely useful, and altogether more efficient than the work done on Odyssey during the construction of the MTVs. However, Gateway’s time on station would be short, as big things were happening soon, and the station would once again be called to action. While the continued missions were oftentimes seen as less exciting than the first or more daring, to the families of the crew, it didn’t matter. Their return was something to be celebrated, a victory over the void of space that carried with it risks that were still in the forefront of every astronaut’s mind. For the crew, their stay at Gusev Crater had been nothing short of extraordinary. Work conducted on the surface had included sampling of some of the lakebed, and a traverse up to the Ma’adim Vallis - a strange feature, which seemed to suggest mass outflow occurred at some point in the region’s past. It had been an arduous trudge, necessitating completing the last 15 km on foot and in their shorter range unpressurized rover - but it had been worth it. The crew had spent many an hour working in the site, using their rover as a mobile base, rather than simply a vehicle to get them from A to B. Work done with both Argonaut and Chariot had pointed out a feature which was needed for future operations on the planet’s surface - direct integration with a base. While the suitport design of the ARES suits had enabled fairly seamless transition from habitat to rover, there was no ability to do a shirtsleeve transfer - something the crews desperately desired. This was ultimately reflected to those working on upcoming base plans on Earth, as plans were soon turning into reality. The work done on Horizon had inspired some considerable thought for how best to tackle base building, and posed some unique questions, notably, how to setup a base in as few launches as possible with as little landed equipment. Horizon had shown that converting tankage had been remarkably easy, and so, considerations for an 8.4 meter habitat began to bear fruit, slowly forming into what would become the final design of Foundation Base, the first permanent habitat on the surface of the Red Planet.</span></p>

At High Bay 2 in the Vehicle Assembly Building, a behemoth spacecraft was undergoing final integration with its carrier rocket, a Jupiter-OPAV stack with the fleet leading <i>Adventure</i> standing proud. It had been a long campaign to get here, thousands of hours of build and testing, shipping and stacking - not to mention years of planning work on the part of the design team, but Horizon was at last ready to roll. Her voyage would start, like a great many payloads, on Pad 39A - but a long ride was required to get even there. On February 14, 2014, the Crawler Transporter would trundle out from the monolithic building, illuminated by the flood lamps along the crawlerway, moving through the misty Florida night. She didn’t look too different from the tanks and other structures that had been launched on Jupiter-OPAV before, albeit, she bore the name Space Station Horizon on her side - a reminder of her purpose. She also bore some lumps and bumps, window, thruster, and solar array coverings designed to ensure that everything stayed where it needed to be during launch. In fact, she wasn’t surrounded by a payload fairing at all, just end caps that connected to the launch vehicle, and a nose cone for aerodynamics. It was fairly unconventional, but that had been the case for many an OPAV launch in the past. On February 20th, the first tanking operations could begin, a long and delicate process to ensure that the vehicles would be ready for their launch early the next morning. However, this would not be the case, a faulty valve onboard Adventure would once again delay the launch to the 26th, giving time for a most special guest to arrive. Commander Douglass and her old crewmate, Thomas Bromley, would stand on the roof of the VAB, watching as <i>Adventure’s</i> SSMEs roared to life, lighting her SRBs and lifting off from the pad - rising into the warm Florida evening. “Look Anna,” he remarked, with his usual charm, “there’s your next chance to make history.” In many ways, the night felt just like it did all those years, watching the first tanks being lofted into space for the construction of the MTVs - an age of both uncertainty, and hope and excitement for the future. As the vehicle ascended into the clouds, and the crackle of the SRBs faded, Anna sighed, pondering her next move. Her return to space had sat in her mind for a long time, something she was ready for, yet, there were elements that felt incomplete… People she missed. Bromley’s company had been welcome, they often spent their time in Florida together, reminiscing about their days in training, but something felt somehow… off. It hung in her mind, and as the range was cleared once more, and Horizon separated from its carrier rocket, she breathed a sigh of relief, her brain finally freed from the agony of launch day. Good orbit and solar array deployment was called out, and the teams on the ground felt the tension in their chest loosen.  The atmosphere of the evening was jovial, warm embraces and handshakes all around. Anna would revel in it, yet, she continued to find herself preoccupied with the thought of something being missing. As she descended from the VAB, hugging her old friend goodbye, she would step into the driver's seat of her car, and pick up her phone.<br>

As Horizon spread her wings in orbit, rolling out her solar arrays and checking out her orbital maneuvering system, a skeleton crew onboard Odyssey prepared for her final moments. The last expedition to the outpost, Expedition 67, had spent time tinkering with any last experiments, and preparing for the end of the line for this historic outpost. They had departed nearly 2 weeks earlier, leaving the station uncrewed for the first time since its early days, a haunting reminder of what was to come. For nearly 25 years, Odyssey had been a key component in all activities for NASA and their partners, from advancing life science to constructing MTVs. <i>Discovery</i> had brought the current crew up 3 days prior, with the task of transferring the last bits of science from the spacecraft, and installing a module to assist with deorbit. It was a solemn moment, but a necessary one - the station had been operational for a long time, mementos and pictures of the crew adorned the interior, adding to the eclectic use of space. The four person crew on <i>Discovery</i> would work swiftly, while still taking time to slow down and admire all that they had done, leaving behind a letter on behalf of the entire Olympus partnership. It read: “Dearest Odyssey, we are sorry that this day had to come, it has been a journey like no other. From your first launch all those years ago, and all of the memories made onboard this station, it has truly been an honor to consider you as an international home in orbit. You’ve done an exceptional job pushing us, as a species, further and higher, and reminded us to stay grounded in the face of adversity. For all that you’ve done, and your continued legacy, we thank you.” After 11 days in orbit, <i>Discovery</i> would cast off from the station one final time, leaving behind a relic of a long forgotten era in space exploration. As it faded from view, the crew of <i>Discovery</i> would hold a press conference, thanking the crews at Johnson and Marshall for all they had done, and supporting human spaceflight beyond. As the orbiter’s double sonic booms woke Titusville Florida, in orbit, the last few hours for Odyssey were dawning. Station controllers, including flight veteran Todd Mitchell, would give the final command to the deorbit module, firing its thrusters for 100 seconds to bring the gargantuan structure within the grasp of the Earth’s atmosphere, over the Pacific ocean. For the team on the ground, it was a moment they had seen coming for years, but as the call went out, it absolutely did not feel real. This structure, several hundred tons in orbit, was moving. Thrusters and control moment gyroscopes, aged by the sun and harsh environment in space, did their best to keep the station pointed in the right direction, and the solar arrays vibrated under the loading. As the 100 seconds elapsed, the fuel would be exhausted, and for the first time in years, the station could drift free, free from the rigors of precise pointing and stabilization, free from the anxious energy of the astronaut teams. The tenuous atmosphere of Earth would begin to lick at the station, like some great beast pulling and tearing at the delicate butterfly wings of the facility. Soon, the plasma of the atmosphere would wrap its claw hand around her, beginning to tear limb from limb. The solar arrays went first, whipping in the ever thickening air stream. The station would begin to tumble, torn asunder by the forces of the planet that birthed it. The CBMs, groaning and straining under the pressure, would give next, and the structure would go from one to several points of light in the night sky, a field of stars. Soon, the forces of the planet would render her one with nature, the memories within her returned to planet Earth, and the controllers in Houston would declare her mission complete - a moment that would live in their heads for the rest of their lives.<br>

At launch sites across the world, launch prep was well underway, not just for the start of the next Olympus mission, but for a new age of robotic explorers that would assist future crews at the Red Planet. The fleet of orbiters and spacecraft at the planet had been in operation since the late 80s at the latest, and were slowly running into problems. The largest issue was the imaging and weather systems, deployed onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Imager, and the Zreniye relay deployed by the former Soviet Union. Two new satellites would be launched to a low orbit to pick up the slack, Mars Radar Sentinel, provided by ESA, and the Martian Global Observer - a NASA led design built around a powerful multispectral imaging suite. Mars Radar Sentinel would act as a multi-use imaging platform, its powerful radar suite looking deep within the planet for sources of water ice that could be conducive to sustainable operations, and even fuel production on the planet. As the window opened, MGO would be the first off the pad, riding an Atlas NG on toward the Red Planet. Mars Radar Sentinel would be next, leaping off the pad in Korou onboard an Ariane 5, treating spectators at the Jupiter Control Facility to a spectacular twilight liftoff. For Russia, and in response to the failure of Zreniye 2 late last year, a handover of new build responsibility would allow for the Japanese to contribute to the orbital fleet in a sharing of duties. The Japanese would ultimately propose to replace the entire fleet of relays one orbiter at a time, starting with Martian Relay Network-1. These spacecraft, derived from smaller geostationary communications systems, would be launched atop both American and Japanese vehicles, enabling the entire fleet of 3 to be deployed simultaneously. Russia, and their greater European partners, would begin work on something bigger, a new type of cargo lander that would enable bulk cargo resupply to the surface, much bigger than the drop pods that had been deployed for previous sorties. This would remove some of the strain from the American cargo modules that were projected to be in use for some time at Foundation. These new vehicles would make use of a landing system known as HIAD, the Hypersonic Inflatable Atmospheric Decelerator, which had been demonstrated on Earth onboard Lockheed Martin’s Atlas NG vehicles. As the probes cast off, and work on the ground began for the new cargo lander, the crew of Olympus 13 would make their final preparations for life on another world.</span></p>

“Liftoff of <i>Intrepid</i> with the crew of Olympus 13, an international crew pushing higher and faster than ever, ready to prepare for the next phase of Martian exploration!”&ZeroWidthSpace;</div><br>
The veteran orbiter pushed through the low Florida cloud layer, her twin solid rocket motors crackling as she carried the next crew of Martians to their waiting transfer vehicle, <i>Minerva</i> - having just finished her refit in orbit. The crew of Olympus 13 was no less diverse than all who had come before her, a stunning example of the strides humanity could take together. Commanding the mission was American Michael Fields, a former Navy Seal and medical doctor who had flown two rotations to Odyssey prior to her decommissioning. He was joined on the flight deck by Australia’s Olivia Fisher, a veteran Qantas pilot who had been accepted into the 2007 astronaut class, becoming the Land from Down Under’s second female astronaut. The third ranking flight surgeon, Timothy Hoult, was a British-American doctor flying for ESA, having completed two stays at the South Pole, one at Concordia Station and one at Amundsen-Scott. Russia’s Sergei Nikolaev would be commanding their lander, <i>Aquila</i>, down to the planet’s surface at the foothills of Phlegra Montes, one of the highest inclination landings so far. It would be from here where they would encounter Argonaut, and make the traverse to potentially view the polar ice caps up close for the very first time. The remaining crew, Theodoro Vargas of Spain, Loral Mendelson and Michelle Weaver of the United States, and finally, Riko Eiko of Japan. All were trained in mountaineering, something they would be accomplishing during their extended duration expedition to the Martian surface. Of note, Michelle Weaver would become the first Native American woman on a mission to the Red Planet, a huge accomplishment for the Cherokee Nation. As <i>Intrepid</i> cast off her external tank, opening her payload bay to the sun, the crew would take a few moments to reflect, photographing their home planet, and their great spacecraft that hung above them. A day and a half later, they were docked with the veteran MTV, and could begin to unload their cargo in preparation for their voyage. After 6 days of combined operations, <i>Intrepid</i> would depart, leaving the crew of 8 ready to commence the journey of a lifetime. <i>Aquila</i> would be the first element to depart, followed closely by <i>Minerva</i>, ready to make history once again. By no means routine, these missions were almost commonplace, a step for humanity towards a multi-planetary existence governed by science and exploration. </span></p>
