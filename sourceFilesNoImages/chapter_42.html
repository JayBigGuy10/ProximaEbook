  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">"T</span><span class="calibre6">oday, New Year’s Day, 2017, we have achieved something great. On the dusty plains of Mongolia, three men stepped out of a Shenzhou capsule, alive and well. And we, at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, played a part. Equipment launched by the United States and our partners enabled us to respond rapidly to the first ever declaration of Article V of the Outer Space Treaty - necessitating that we help astronauts in need. Now, you may ask, why did we not speak out sooner? Why did we withhold information about the crisis in space? We felt it necessary to stay focused, to gather the facts, and to work with our new found comrades in space to get the job done - and that we have. This is a testament to a world united through the common cause of exploration, a world which is strengthened by its bonds with other cultures - we can overcome the impossible. And that we have today. The crew of Baochuán-3, just a few short months ago, faced uncertainty. And the world looked at that in the face and produced an answer. Our rapid response was a testament to the engineering power of our space program, supported internationally by our partners. I would like to thank my colleagues at the CNSA for their support in this operation, and trusting us with a way forward. I hope that this is a new dawn in the age of cooperation in space, a push forward, another momentous leap for all of humankind. Thank you, 谢谢.” <br>

Anna smiled, stepping away from the podium, breathing a sigh of relief. The weight of the last several months had weighed on her, and she could feel the tension of the world leaving her. The scrambling of the MTV had ended up not necessary, something that was much to the relief of the DoD and DoE. It had been a tense few months for the crew, who had been left onboard the MTV to wait out the possibility of a rescue with their lifeboat. Now, <i>Atlantis</i> would be tasked with the safe return of the crew, their mission of "sitting and waiting" complete at last. Baochuán-3 had returned successfully, with the transfer vehicle even braking into low Earth Orbit for repairs. Everything had worked as they’d hoped, and finally, the world could breathe a little easier. As she walked into the underground parking lot, her phone began to vibrate - a phone call from a blocked number. Sweat formed on her palms, not for fear of consequences, but for the unknown. She held the cell phone to her ear, and for the first time, timidly uttered her hello. On the other end, a familiar voice, Dr Liao’s: “Dr. Douglass. I wanted to call you and thank you for what you did for me and my crew. And for what you did, but did not disclose. We saw all that you did, readying the MTV. It is not hard to disguise your intentions with something like that. But I will say this - That night… with you watching the Shuttle launch, I knew something special was there. I knew you wouldn’t stand by and not have the final say, so… I wanted to thank you personally. You are a good woman, and a good friend, Anna.” It was the first time she had heard the Doctor say her name. It felt kind, she felt kind. Like a friend who had been there all along.<br>

On the Red Planet, the crew of Olympus 14 was preparing to make history. <i>Prometheus</i> and <i>Taurus</i> had so far served the crew well, carrying them to the planet and surface respectively. The landing site, Margaritifer Terra, was a heavily cratered region that had been extensively surveyed from orbit, seen as the gateway site for crew to eventually explore the Marineris region, the site of the upcoming Foundation base. Despite the distance, and the truncated nature of the mission, the crew would make the journey to the valley's ridgelines, humanity’s first look at a structure long seen from the ground. The first photo, taken by mission Surgeon Samantha Barnes, titled <i>Vistas of Another</i> would go on to win the 2017 Sony World Photography award, even before the crew would return. Here, Sam Bianchi would plant a flag of the Olympus program, and speak to the world as many before him had, remarking that the best phase of exploration was yet to come, and the planet of Mars was about to be open to all. “This planet” he would remark, “is a foothold to the stars. As we learn about how to live permanently here, we will gain more - a great achievement for a species who hasn’t been in the game very long.” The crew would once again use their new flying machines, conducting aerial surveys of the space below, identifying the landing ellipse that was to be used by the crew of Olympus 15, and the core module of Foundation with them. As their time on the surface came to an end, the crew would make their way back to the vicinity of their lander-base, wanting to limit the amount of resources they expended. A new technique had been trialed on this mission, the deployment of a greenhouse from one of the Logistics Modules delivered ahead of the crew. This inflatable hab was pressurized on Sol 20, and covered in regolith from Sol 30-43, where setup inside could take place. Not only did this add internal volume to their already rather expansive habitat, but infused an air of home, Planet Earth, into their facility. One of the first steps in setup would be the refining of the Martian soil, not an easy task given the high perchlorate content, which took several long days and a complicated refinement process. Eventually, the first few pounds of bio-treated dirt would be laid down in the new habitat. <i>The first smell of wet earth,</i> Mission Specialist Frederick Wilson would write in his memoir<i>, brought tears to our eyes.</i> <i>We had been treating it for over 4 days, and our first batch was finally ready to be laid down in the greenhouse. We all gathered and took turns shoveling, feeling it between our fingers. It was beautiful… It felt like Genesis. I cannot explain it in any other way.</i> The crew would plant their first crops, buttercrunch lettuce and several types of root vegetables, as well as set up a hydroponic system. Within several weeks, the first crops grown in Martian soil would be harvested, and the crew could begin to ponder the future of the planet, one where humans could walk amongst lush fields in the landscape.<br>
<br>
Soon, their time on the surface would come to a close, and the crew would begin to prepare their intrepid lander for departure - on to the next adventure. There was some degree of apprehension amongst the crew - this was the first time since Olympus 6 that a crew had been split up to conduct a mission, only 4 crew members would be making the journey to Phobos, something which had never been attempted before. As the crew sat on the flight deck of the lander, pilot Dominic Granger would look out the window, and deliver some remarks before he would commit the group to the next phase of their adventure: “As we set off from our position here, our home away from home, we can leave in comfort, knowing that the next time Mars is inhabited by humans, it will be to stay. Godspeed to us, and godspeed to the next crew to view this world, Olympus 15. Preparing for terminal count…” With a go from mission control back on Earth, and good data connection to the Base Station, <i>Taurus</i> and her crew would leave the surface, the penultimate MSAV to do so. Through their ascent, they maintained a solid connection to the complex in orbit, ensuring that their arrival would go smoothly. At last, the great facility came into view, refitted numerous times during the course of the program, and the lander could dock, at rest for just a moment. The next week would see the crew begin to refit the upper stage, and transfer RCS propellant from the Base Station itself into the vehicle. There was enough fuel margin in their upper stage to make the journey to and from Phobos, but additional propellant was required under contingency plans, ensuring that in the event of a propulsion failure, backups were available. The mood in the complex was one of excitement, but the taste of worry lingered in everyone’s mouths. A new moon, a whole new world to explore, was not without risk. Orbiters had imaged Phobos hundreds of times, yet there were going to be features that could not be accounted for, systems that could potentially surpass their design life… That didn’t matter now, not anymore. As Commander Bianchi, the MSAV pilot Adia Alekseeva, Samantha Robinson and Kyle Barnes found themselves secure in the lander’s flight deck, they stared down the barrel of their next great adventure.</span></p>

Departure from the Base Station was slightly less than routine, the reduced weight of the vehicle resulted in more control authority than when departing for a surface sortie. This would concern the crew slightly, as they didn’t want to induce unnecessary vibrations in the Base Station structure. Ever so carefully, <i>Taurus</i> would back away, and the crew on station could get a good look at the vehicle. It looked so small now, compared to the great ship that met them at the beginning of their stay. Alekseeva would ever so carefully back away, with Sam Robinson documenting their departure on their Imax camera. The phasing burns were long, and once they were well clear of the complex, their upper stage engines could be lit once more, pushing them into the raised orbit of Phobos. Rendezvous with the moon was different to that of Earth’s moon - it was more like phasing with a space station rather than attempting to enter a gravity well. The first few hours of coast were largely spent photographing the surface, trying to identify past Olympus sites. It was a peaceful moment, one Robinson would reflect on after her flight, calling the nearly 28 hour transit some of the most boring excitement of her life. The first spotting of the moon would come on the MSAV’s targeting scopes, a small gray dot standing out against the thermal background of space, a striking departure from the burnt orange of the Martian landscape. A panel would flip out on the surface of the MSAV, installed for just this purpose, a laser rangefinder to assist in their approach. The precision guidance would activate, and the crew would strap in, ready for the next phase of their approach. The moon grew in their window, a menacing gray smudge on the wispy Martian atmosphere. <i>Taurus</i> barked and huffed as her RCS jets fine tuned her approach, her electronic eyes scanning the moonlet as it hovered over the planet. Now, the tricky part, arrival. As they crossed within a kilometer, the crew could begin to identify potential areas to secure the MSAV, courtesy of their newly installed Harpoon Kit. Alekseeva would pulse the RCS to maneuver <i>Taurus</i> into an orbit, if one could call it that. It was more so parallel flight, made possible by the moon’s low gravity. Here, they would remain stationary, scanning the surface looking for a landing site. As the crew observed the moon, a complication arose. The surface was covered in a layer of gravel, which would more than certainly be kicked up by any significant impact. <i>Taurus</i>, as robust a vehicle as it was, would be severely compromised if any of this debris would impact vital components. The crew would need to target their harpoons as precisely as possible, avoiding any significant debris kick from the moon. Barnes would take the stick, and begin to align <i>Taurus</i> as best he could - his experience in Australia’s Special Air Service as a sniper coming into its element. Silence filled the flight deck as they watched him, removing his helmet to get as close to the window as possible, gently puffing the RCS jets to stabilize the vehicle. His breath slowed, a ritual perfected in training and on the battlefield. Only the cabin fans would make any noise, and with the squeeze of a trigger, the harpoons would fire. Immediately, the reaction control thrusters would buck against the force of the mortar, and the sound of the cables unwrapping startled the crew from their silence. <i>Taurus</i> shook, preparing for the tug of the moon. Rather violently, the cables made contact in the center of Stickney Crater, and the vehicle began to tighten its grip, switching out of fine guidance mode. <i>Taurus</i> strained, and Bianchi primed the cable cut breaker, ready in case something went wrong. 3 green lights out of 4, one of the cables had not grasped the surface - within their margin but still not ideal. Alekseeva would stabilize the vehicle, groaning under the loads. The vehicle, like a spooked beast, needed time to settle. Soon, silence… Only the sound of their breathing, the fans and the occasional puff of the RCS.  Jubilantly the crew would make the call to their colleagues on the basecamp: “Basecamp, <i>Taurus</i>, we’ve bagged ourselves a moon!” </span></p>

Setup of the descent truss had been an arduous process, only 3 confirmed contacts meant that the lander had to be significantly closer to ensure stability. The crew of four would enter their ARES suits, and begin the 60 meter climb down to the surface, suspended above a world they had started to grow familiar with. Bianchi would be the first down the truss, taking each step carefully. The scale of the world below them was almost nauseating, the curve of the moon was visible and shadows grew long around the terminator. Close behind were Barnes and Robinson, making their way down the truss, followed by Alekseeva. Ever so carefully, they would inch their way down, checking each other’s harnesses and their own gloves. Static charge was a concern on the moon, so coulometers were fixed to the multitool port on their wrist, and fed data directly into their heads up displays. Their MSAV hung above them, casting shadows in the “noon” sun as they descended, now only 20 meters from the surface. Their trepidation sat at the bottom of their boots, crawling up their legs and surrounding their hearts as they approached this alien world. There had not been the buildup of excitement like their landing on the surface of Mars, no great ride through the atmosphere… this was it. Now, just a meter off the surface, Bianchi paused; surveying the landscape of the moon. And there it sat, the final step, the threshold of an alien world that had evaded humanity for so long. He cast his gaze upwards at his crewmates, floating in the nearly undetectable force of gravity that the moon provided. Barnes gave him a thumbs up, and Alekseeva nodded, smiling - the final go ahead to step across that threshold. With a gentle push, his boots sank into the gravely surface of Stickney Crater, humanity’s first steps on another moon. “We have come so far, and there is so much beauty here…” He remarked, pausing to look back at his crew, “and I could not have done it alone. Let’s get to work.”   <br>

Far away, in the depths of space, a transformation was taking place.  Having lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center aboard a Helios launch vehicle only a few weeks prior, the Harriet Tubman Space Telescope was being born. A spacecraft, years in the making, was unfolding into the proper shape, every move carefully choreographed to take place exactly as it needed to happen. Her gold mirrors would never again see the light of day as the sunshield expanded to its final size. Power was flowing through the spacecraft, and coolant would soon bring the spacecraft down to its final operating temperature. On the sunlit side, the docking system, built to enable future servicing and cryogenic refueling, was primed, ensuring that all systems were functional for its projected 20 year lifespan. The telescope had no cameras other than what it carried to gaze into the cosmos, so the crews on the ground could only wait in agony as the great spacecraft bloomed like a flower, every day a step closer to first light. Soon, the wait would be over… and the great telescope would showcase worlds like no other - a window into time itself. </span></p>
