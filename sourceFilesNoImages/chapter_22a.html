  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Good morning everyone!, Hope you all have had a good week, and have enjoyed meeting our new crew in the latest post. Today we'll be looking at some more amazing images from <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> who has once again been so kind to provide us with such amazing storytelling elements. You should also go check out his work on his recreation of the Constellation program, which you can find links to on his twitter! Our next chapter is going to focus on the rotations of crew to and from Mars, as well as highlight <i>Hera's</i> historic mission to Venus, which will certainly be something to behold. That being said, let's take a look at some shots from this week in universe!</span></p>

  <i>One of Odyssey's biggest upgrades, the addition of new solar panels, would enable the station to finally be free of power issues that had plagued it for years. Another set of robotic arms would help with construction and future aggregation efforts.

  <i>The biggest addition to the habitable volume of the station would be the Copernicus laboratory, enabling more crew space to be used as well as adding an additional sleep station for European astronauts. An external pallet would enable crew interface with technologies being worked on outside of the station. Liberté "Haven" is docked to the lower forward port.

  <i>Every passing hour, Mars grows smaller, and soon the features that the crew could gaze at from orbit would no longer be visible. Soon after their departure, dust storms would cover the planet, putting the instruments they left behind to the test.

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi everyone!, This week, space is <i>very</i> busy, and our various crews in orbit have a lot of work cut out for them. The return of Olympus 3, and the arrival at Mars of Olympus 4 is indicative of the ways in which our architecture is shifting towards <i>sorties</i> at Mars rather than one shot missions. It is, after all, the goal of this series to make space exploration sustainable. I wanna give a huge shoutout once again to <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PZerg5" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Zarbon</a>, who have done a huge amount of work on this project. They've really raised the bar, in my eyes, for this project. I couldn't do it without them! Anyway, let's get into it!</span></p>
