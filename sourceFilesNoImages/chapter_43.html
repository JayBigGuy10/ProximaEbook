I feel alright… yes, yes, the weather looks good here today, I feel good about our chances of making it off the ground today, our weather concerns from last week are no more, I think… Is she sleeping? She’s up? Put her on the phone… Hello kiddo, did you stay up all night? Oh, your mom let you? Okay… Yeah, your papa’s all ready to go… I know it's a long time, but I promise I’ll be back soon. N-no… nothing bad is gonna happen. Papa’s friend Anna is gonna call you and your mom later, okay? You remember Miss Anna… The nice lady who helped Mama out..  Promise me you’ll focus on your schoolwork, and take care of Mama? Good, I love you, let me speak to your mother okay?... Hi Sylvia, no, I feel alright… The dreams were there just a bit last night. But I’ll be alright. It’s time for me to get going. I love you. Anna will call you soon, okay? I love you with all of my heart, please don’t ever forget that.”</span><br>

<span class="calibre21">S</span>ergei Ivanov set the phone down on the side table in the suit up room, and cast his gaze out to the launch pad. It was a quiet morning in the jungle, birds and various other creatures had not yet roused from their slumber to start their day. There, four miles away, sat a EuroZenit, steaming in the early morning mists of the Amazon Rainforest. Liberte <i>Dream</i> had been rolled out two days prior, standing tall at the pad in its clusters of support towers. A familiar hand rested on Ivanov’s shoulder, former Olympus 9 crewmate Dr. Nicolas Delon. Their assignment to Athena had been somewhat of a blessing for Ivanov, now staring down the barrel of command. He had stressed to his superiors that the rigors of flight would be easier on him if there were a few familiar faces. Delon had been a natural choice, for he had been the glue of the crew post accident, ensuring that they all spent time together whenever possible. “Come on Sergei,” Delon remarked, a technician performing checks on his Fenix suit, “I think it is time for our adventure to begin.” Ivanov smiled, gathering his life support briefcase, and headed for the double doors. The crew of four would leave the grip of the planet just under two hours later, setting a course for Athena. Their ascent was flawless, powering across the Atlantic ocean in the morning light - visible just for a moment along the coast of Columbia. With a thump, their second stage would fire, and Ivanov would find himself releasing his grip from his harness, a moment of anxiety over. The second stage would continue the push, the four crew members pressed into their seats - nearly there. With a second thump, and a moment of silence, they knew they had done it. Orbit. Now, floating free from their carrier rocket, the crew could begin to explore their next steps. Their mission was to oversee the expansion of the facility, the final in a series planned to maximize use of the station. For this, the Americans would contribute an inflatable module, derived from technology used on the iconic MTVs. Docking would take place two days after liftoff, and as Ivanov entered the station, and gazed down at the Earth, he would pick up his phone to call his wife and daughter, remarking at the majesty of the world below them, and wishing he could bring the view to them. With this, work could begin in earnest, setting up a new workshop inside the station’s new, vast interior. This would be one of the final expansions to Athena before she was declared “optimally complete”, the final addition being a solar array tower to be delivered by the Americans. Athena had grown from humble beginnings into a station that stood apart from the rest. A capable crewed and uncrewed platform, Athena stood to be a leader alongside her big sister Horizon for years to come. <br>

The work done on the surface of Phobos had revealed more than planetary scientists could have ever hoped for. The rocky, miniscule world was something of an oddity on its discovery, what appeared to be a trapped asteroid orbiting low around the planet. Work done on the surface by Olympus 14 had revealed a world with a long history, closer to the asteroids found in the furthest reaches of the asteroid belt. It furthered the theory that these two, strange little moons were captured asteroids, brought into orbit of Mars by some sort of great disturbance eons ago. Over 60 kg of samples were retrieved from the surface, bringing forth a new era of understanding for the diminutive moon. Soon, the crew of intrepid moon explorers would be reunited with their comrades in low Martian orbit. The job done, they would send <i>Taurus</i> to its disposal orbit, a nearly tearful farewell for a ship that had served them so gallantly. Like a great beast awakening from its slumber, <i>Prometheus’</i> engines would roar to life in the vacuum of space, pushing the crew towards their home planet, a blue green marble suspended so delicately in the cosmos. As the Red Planet faded from view, Commander Bianchi would reflect on his position now - the first human to walk upon the surface of Phobos, another moon. Quietly, he wondered where this plucky little species would go next. As the crew of Olympus 14 set sail for home, a plethora of launches would begin at Kennedy Space Center and Baikonur Cosmodrome, starting with one most crucial - Phoenix class MADV 1, <i>Enterprise</i>. Stacking of the MADV on top of Jupiter-OPAV had been a complex and time consuming endeavor, special aero-skirts had to be installed to account for the biplane like fins of the vehicle. Engineers at Michoud had not been pleased with the requirements, but knew that this would only have to happen twice. With Enterprise stacked, and <i>Adventure</i> firmly bolted to the side of the vehicle, the countdown could begin for her maiden flight. A little over two weeks after rollout, Enterprise would leap off the pad, her immense weight obvious in the flight profile of the vehicle. Nearly 9 minutes after liftoff, Enterprise would be floating free, with Adventure beginning her once around to be recovered by ground teams. In Baikonur, the 13th and final MSAV, <i>Hydra</i>, would roll out to the pad, the culmination of over 20 years of international cooperation. With a great roar, the Energia’s plethora of engines would ignite, lofting the vehicle skywards. In orbit, the two landers would be docked to their Transfer Elements, as the final checks were being performed on <i>Selene</i>. Her last flight, Olympus 12, had showcased just how capable of a vehicle she was, a more modernized version of the iconic MTVs that had served humanity for so many years. The final launch of the campaign would be the Foundation Core Module, launched in a similar style to that of Horizon not too long ago. The vehicle would be enshrouded this time in a hammerhead aeroshell, another first for the Jupiter-OPAV program, due to the slight bulge outwards of the airlock. The vehicle would be the penultimate flight of the campaign, riding <i>Tenacity</i> to orbit after a 24 hour recycle in the count. The OPAV system was coming up on its 30th year of flight, and remained a leader in heavy lift for NASA and the Olympus partners, a key asset in ensuring a sustainable human presence on Mars. It maintained its nearly spotless service record for delivering payloads to orbit, even with the <i>Perseverance</i> accident still sitting in some folk’s minds. Finally, the last piece of the puzzle would roll out, <i>Intrepid</i> in all her glory. Her time as the Martian Support Orbiter was coming to an end, it would seem, as activities around the cape seemed to preclude her existence, and the shuttle fleet as a whole. Venturestar had shown that it was capable of lifting cargo to stations, and the Advanced Crew Exploration Vehicle would soon fill the crew vehicle role, bringing astronauts to their waiting chariots. But for now, it was her time to shine. The international crew, commanded by American Michael Mikulka, would lift off on <i>Intrepid’s</i> first attempt, carrying the valiant crew skyward to the waiting <i>Selene</i>, waiting for them like a sleeping leviathan. Docking would take place nearly two days later, and <i>Intrepid</i> would perform the usual pleasantries, unloading late-stage cargo and prepping the crew for their voyage to the Red Planet. Soon, the greatest fleet ever assembled would commit to their voyage, a product of years of planning, now culminating in the first steps towards permanent settlement on the surface of Mars. <br>
<br>
On the pad at LC-41 sat a new breed of spacecraft, one years in the making. The Advanced Crew Exploration vehicle, derived from the iconic lifeboats that had kept crews of Olympus missions safe, was now a fully fledged spacecraft in its own right. With a new, robust, multirole service module, the vehicle was capable of flights to Low Earth Orbit as well as continuing to support sorties to the Red Planet. The vehicle would soon, if the first test flight went well, take over the crew role from the venerable Space Shuttle, something the NASA workforce had been quietly coming to terms with for many years. Lessons learned from the shuttle program also enabled reusability to be incorporated into the capsule’s design The launch vehicle was also making its debut, however, it was not entirely new. The first stage was an Atlas NG stage, two AR1 engines in their recovery pod and six solid rocket motors, while the upper stage consisted of the new Centaur EvO, a 5.4 meter cryogenic stage with the powerful RL60 engine. ACEV sat tucked in an adapter fairing, adorned with its Launch Escape Tower, cryogenic steam venting from the upper stage. Today’s flight would be uncrewed, a two week demonstration mission to Horizon, where her systems would be checked in preparation for her debut on crew rotation missions, as well as on sorties to the Red Planet. The first vehicle, <i>Columbia</i>, had rolled off the joint Airbus-Lockheed production line and had been outfitted with as-close to mission ready equipment as possible. In the early spring morning of April 26, the 6 solid rocket motors and twin AR1s would roar to life, and the vehicle would leap off the pad. The brilliant light and crackle of the engines would wake a sleeping Titusville, as the launch commentators called out status updates. The vehicle would quickly pierce Mach 1, its solid motors jettisoning into the turbulent airstream below it. Soon, the booster core would be drained of its fuel, and the new upper stage would ignite, pushing <i>Columbia</i> into its parking orbit. The vehicle performed flawlessly, and soon, the new crew vehicle would be free to extend its quad solar panels, soaking up the sun on the trek to Horizon. The vehicle would take a slower route to the station, a two day rendezvous to check out systems and ensure that all was well for docking. The crew of Expedition 5, having just been delivered by <i>Challenger</i>, would stand at the ready to receive the vehicle on the aft docking port. Like a bird of prey, <i>Columbia</i> would silently stalk her target, performing a fly around maneuver for crew inspection. The first American capsule to fly since the mid 70s, and she looked damn fine. The vehicle would come to port on the aft end of the station, and the docking rings would merge two spacecraft into one. Now, joined at last, the past, present and future of spaceflight would come into focus. The crew would board <i>Columbia</i> and inspect her systems, rummaging around the flight deck. She was only designed for short term operations, however, a crew of 8 would make the squeeze onboard if needed - mostly for ferry flights to stations or waiting MTVs. Missions on their own were also possible, usually accompanied by waiting transfer elements or logistics modules. The spacecraft’s hum was different, not clunky and mechanical like the shuttle before it, but soft, smooth, almost sterile. Not lived in yet. The crew knew, in their minds, that this would soon change. After a week of operations on the station, the hatches would be sealed, and the great spacecraft would part ways. Onboard cameras on <i>Columbia</i> would document the departure, and soon, the station would be nothing more than a speck of light in the thermal cameras. The crew onboard Horizon would watch as she plunged through the atmosphere, heading for a picture perfect landing off the coast of Hawaii. The next generation of crew vehicles was here.</span></p>

  <i>Cast free of Phaeton, Odysseus and Telemachus can begin their long journey towards Neptune, well over a decade in deep space...</i>
</span></p>

  <br/> 

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
On Launch Pad 39A, Jupiter-OPAV <i>Inspiration</i> sat steaming in the Florida heat, in the final phases of fuel top up before her projected liftoff window. <i>Inspiration</i> was one of the least used OPAV pods of the fleet, having been taken offline temporarily to be refitted with advanced flight control systems, and upgraded engines. Now, she was poised to return to the fold, launching <i>Odysseus</i> and its transfer stage towards Neptune. As missions had gone, she was pretty advanced, weight had been shaved in various areas, and new technologies implemented designed to prove their worth in deep space. Years of cruise meant the spacecraft had to be hardened against the brutal forces of cosmic radiation, and careful management of fuel. She also required power to be available for a long time to come, so solar cells were immediately out of the question. Instead, she resembled something like an out of shape Cassini, her propulsion and utility section covered in powerful radioisotope thermoelectric generators, with a series of lithium ion battery banks onboard. Her electronic sensor system, called NSIM (Neptune System Imaging Matrix), would be some of the most powerful optics ever deployed in deep space. Onboard, the probe carried a passenger, the <i>Telemachus</i> atmospheric probe. On a crisp fall morning at the Cape, <i>Inspiration</i> and her Phaeton upper stage would break free from the gravity of the planet, and begin to power the mission towards a rendezvous with Neptune. After nearly 25 minutes of powered flight, the spacecraft would separate from its carrier rocket, turning back to look at the planet from whence it came, the first steps in a brand new adventure. Nearly 13 years later, <i>Odysseus</i> and <i>Telemachus</i> would arrive at Neptune, ready to begin a long and storied career as one of the Solar System's most intrepid explorers... </span></p>
