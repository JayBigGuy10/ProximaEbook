  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hello everyone!, I'm super excited to be back and bringing you our 43rd chapter, only a few more weeks now, isn't that crazy? This week, I wanna thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/LM__Steve" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Steven</a>, who've given us some amazing images as usual. I wanted to take some time to say thank you to everyone who's read so far, I cannot explain how much I appreciate the time and care you all have given me. It is an honor to be here! As we come to the end, I am considering what is next, and I cannot wait to share what I have in store. We are really just getting started. Let's jump right in!</span></p>
