  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all!, I want to dive in today and showcase some of the amazing parts of our journey this week, talk about some changes I made vs. real life, and discuss some scheduling! Let's get the business of logistics out of the way first - I am actually graduating from undergrad this weekend! I was part of the class of 2020, but due to world events I wasn't able to have my graduation in person. This weekend we're being honored with a ceremony out of state!. I also wanted to take a moment to talk about Cassini - it looks a little different right? My logic is that design changes over time will almost certainly take place, so that's why the orbiter looks a tad bit different. Let's get on with the show, and showcase some incredible work from <a href="https://twitter.com/LM__Steve" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Steven</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a>!</span></p>

  <i>Cassini swings wide around the planet Saturn, having completed its first orbit. For the foreseeable future, she will observe the ringed giant in all its glory, advancing human knowledge about the mystery world.

  <i>The European Huygens probe was an early star of the mission, conducting the first outer solar system landing on Saturn's veiled moon - Titan. Information gathered from Titan would inform decades of Solar System exploration planning and development.

  <i>The solid kick motors expended, Scorpius ignites its twin LE-57M engines, an upgrade from the previous single engine of the Block I landers. These will carry the vehicle all the way to orbit, humanity's second SSTO after the Apollo LM ascent stage.

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all, I did it! I walked for my much delayed graduation! Taking a small break was definitely a good move, and I'm back and even more excited than ever to get started and explore this amazing world with you. This week, we're exploring more of the surface of Mars, and planning for our future in Low Earth Orbit, something we haven't really touched on in a while. I'm super grateful as always to have such amazing collaborators, and I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> for being such a wonderful contributor to this project. Next week I should have a really wonderful chapter for you all to enjoy. Let's get on with the show!</span></p>
