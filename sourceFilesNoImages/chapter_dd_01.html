  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">A</span><span class="calibre6">s the fleet around Mars continued to work, the scientists back on Earth began to piece together a look at what lay on and below the surface of Mars. Key to the upcoming missions, and one of the questions that had been puzzling scientists for decades, was the question of whether or not water was present on the Red Planet, and might this lead them to find life. Soon, the answers would be clear. <i>Vody's </i>instruments had been hard at work seeking out signs of hydrogen, which would indicate the potential for liquid or frozen water to exist nearby. What they found would astonish them. Shown in a map that would stun the world, a comprehensive look at the composition of the planet that gave rise to even further excitement. In a joint statement on December 24, 1987, the Soviets and JPL explained that deep blue areas at the high latitudes mark the lowest levels of neutrons from cosmic rays, which have been interpreted to indicate the presence of high levels of hydrogen. The hydrogen enrichment, in turn, is suggestive of large reservoirs of water ice below the surface.

  Another stunning map would come in the form of the total surface area topography map, which gave rich insight into the terrain of the planet, something that could even potentially be plotted in 3D. This map was a godsend, a truly indicative tool to help mission planners determine in even greater detail what the most ideal mission sites would be for the program.  It was a wealth of data, and gave those in charge of mission planning even more to pour over in the quest to get boots on the ground.</span></p>
