  <i>ACEV Columbia heads into the unknown once more, on a mission to rendezvous with and service the Harriet Tubman Space Telescope.</i>
</span></p>

  <br/> 

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
<span class="calibre21">T</span>he Harriet Tubman Space Telescope had last been seen by human eyes several weeks before its departure, enclosed in its payload fairing, sealed from the outside world. Now, in May of 2021, the crew of ACEV<i> Columbia</i> closed in, and could begin to pick out details on the glinting surface of this not too distant star. In its first few years of operation, HTST had performed well, yet, there was always work to be done. The HTST was designed to be serviced periodically, enabling new instruments to be swapped out on the sunlit side of the spacecraft, equipment that could enable new discoveries to be made. The convoy of <i>Columbia</i> and her mission module had been launched two and a half weeks prior, rolling out to pads 39A and 41 in tandem. The first launch would be the ACEV vehicle itself, carrying four astronauts to a Medium Earth Orbit. The second launch would be OPAV <i>Tenacity</i>, carrying with it a Phaeton upper stage and a small habitat/airlock combo, and a pallet external cargo. This second launch would see the stack inserted into a slightly lower orbit, left to phase slowly over the next several days before finally encountering the crew in their capsule. Now, acting as the active spacecraft, <i>Columbia</i> would inch closer, nearly nose to nose, before the connection was made, securing her to the stack. Phaeton would ignite her RL60 engines and begin the kick out to L2, a quiet and relatively short journey compared to the arduous ordeal of a flight to Mars. Approaching the telescope would be the hard part, with the sensitive instruments just barely out of the firing line of a rogue thruster plume. <i>Columbia</i> would have to work diligently to ensure that her velocity for docking would be sufficient well before she would need to fire her thrusters. It was a slow approach, much slower than any approach to any object in recent spaceflight history. The sunshield, as useful as it was for the telescope, proved to be particularly troublesome, as the glinting of the material blinded optical sensors. But, ACEV endured, and the soft capture latches of the Mission Module would embrace the telescope, ready at last to begin work on this distant jewel of human creation. The work would be arduous, 4 EVAS would be required to carefully manage and install equipment, ensuring that extreme care was taken to not harm the fragile structure beyond the sunshield. Columbia did her job diligently, holding the attitude of the combined Telescope-Spacecraft complex on reaction wheels alone. After 6 grueling days of EVAs, the “New Worlds Chronograph” had been installed, and its occulter launched onboard an Atlas vehicle from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, well on its way to rendezvous with the intrepid telescope. The crew of <i>Columbia</i> would soon undock from the telescope, the force of their springs on the Soft Capture Device pushing them slowly away. After nearly 6 hours of coasting, they were within an acceptable distance to fire their thrusters, and begin the long voyage home. After nearly two weeks of coasting, <i>Columbia</i> would cast off her Mission Module and spend the final 6 hours of her voyage alone, her crew preparing to feel the pull of gravity once more. In the final hour, she would separate from her European Service Module, and orient the heat shield towards the planet below her, bracing as the atmosphere would envelop them in a ball of ionized plasma. Ever so gradually, the forces of gravity would begin to pull on the crew, tugging them deeper into their seats. Soon, the chutes would unfurl, and the crew of the USS <i>San Diego</i> would spot <i>Columbia</i> as she drifted down towards the glassy Pacific Ocean, her mission of exploration and engineering complete at last.    <br>

On the surface of Mars, what had started as a small blip on the Martian surface now resembled something substantial. In the absence of crew, a robotic cohort had been hard at work preparing a dedicated landing zone for the upcoming arrival of <i>Enterprise</i>. These robots, left behind by the previous crew, would construct this new arrival platform out of concrete, manufactured by adding a binding agent to the soil. Work done all of those years during earlier Olympus expeditions had shown how stable the regolith could be if bound, making it a viable building component for future endeavors. It was a slow, tedious task, but the window of time between the previous crew’s departure and the next crew’s arrival was satisfactory. Soon, the stillness of orbit would be broken, and the robots littering the surface would scurry away as they prepared for the arrival of their distinguished guests. There was of course still work to be done, but for now, the crew had a place to go - a location to head towards as they prepared for their sortie on the surface. In orbit, the crew of Olympus 16 would file into their lander, <i>Enterprise</i>, and prepare her for the journey ahead. She bore her first markings of the Martian surface, soot from her plasma inducing entry and dust clinging to her landing pads. She was a veteran of the Martian biosphere, ready to deliver her crew to the surface. After retracting the latches in the docking mechanism, she could begin her long fall to the planet, using her active aero-surfaces to guide her as the atmosphere began to thicken. The vibrations in the cabin would grow stronger now, the vehicle dipping into its shuttle heritage to perform a series of lazy S-turns, slowly bleeding off speed as the computer honed in on the landing site. Once a speck on cameras in orbit would soon fill their scopes, <i>Enterprise</i> working hard to fine tune her guidance. The flashing lights of the base, an indicator of its position at night, would soon guide the crew towards their final maneuvers. <i>Enterprise</i> would light two of her engines and execute the “nose up” maneuver, swinging her into the correct orientation for landing. Her remaining four engines would light, and ever so gently, she would come to a stop on the surface, earning her Martian wings for a second time. The crew onboard were ecstatic, the first <i>repeat</i> landing of a crew vehicle on the Martian surface, returning to an outpost that had previously been visited. As the crew descended the elevator, and took their first few cautious steps on the dusty red plains, Commander Vilko could not help but feel as though everyone who had come before was cheering for them now - a reminder of the power of teamwork and cooperation that had enabled such a monumental human feat. The crew would process in two lines across the landscape, assessing their ship, as they made their way beyond the berm and to the base. Vilko, leading the pack, would stop for a moment as the facility came into view, its blinking lights and spires reminiscent of something small… a city. The first human settlement on Mars was ready and waiting. Waiting for all that would come next. Waiting for all the people to follow. Vilko could not help but cheer, and his teammates would embrace one another as they entered the Hab, ready to begin nearly 500 days of hard science on the Red Planet, aided by humans and machines alike. They were pioneers all over again.</span></p>

In its quiet orbit, Tianyu had blossomed into something grand. Once the assembly point for missions to other worlds, like Odyssey, it had grown into something far more than a waypoint to other places. Tianyu had become a fully fledged laboratory, hosting six crew members at a time via two Shenzhou vehicles. Additional modules were added to provide power for the growing complex, as well as habitation space and the ability to service spacecraft externally. The laboratory had become somewhat of a nexus for human spaceflight outside of just Chinese Taikonauts, exchange flights had begun in earnest to the station in the interest of cooperation. Years ago, when China would make their first forays into space, they had made a point to go at it alone. There was considerable economic, social and political pressure for them to do so. But now, the curtains were beginning to be drawn back, and the world was starting to understand the Chinese space program as the capable entity that it was. The first flight of an international astronaut to Tianyu would come in January of 2021, with the United Kingdom’s Timothy Hoult flying in the Mission Specialist seat onboard Shenzhou-19. His four month stay in the laboratory would be a monumental achievement, and would be followed closely by an exchange flight in May to Athena. This would see a crew onboard Shenzhou 21 approach and dock with the station, completing science and outreach objectives over the span of 20 days. This would begin a close partnership between the European Space Agency, who themselves had cemented themselves as brokers of international spaceflight relations. Exchange flights would soon become a yearly occurrence, but it left the question of how best to handle one of the biggest players in spaceflight, NASA. While relations were certainly warmer than they were prior to the incident at 2003 TK9, there was a degree of animosity that still remained. ESA would step up to the plate and organize what some viewed as the spiritual successor to the Apollo Soyuz Test Project, a joint flight to Europe’s own station onboard both Liberté and Shenzhou, with the intent of exploring cooperative dialogue. This mission, later dubbed the Athena Conference, would see the four great space powers, the United States, Europe, Russia and China meet face to face in orbit for the first time, and engage in open and honest dialogue about their future. It was difficult, at times, to come to agreements about the best interests of these agencies, and bridging their cultural divides was not a challenge to be taken lightly - but at the end of the day, their very locale reminded them of the sheer magnitude of their mission. The crew would find themselves, in their spare moments, gathering around the various windows of the complex, admiring the features on Earth that they called home. It would be at this moment, on the last day of combined flight, when a bright spot would emerge on the east coast of India, a spark in the twilight. From the ground, the roar of twin solid rocket motors would shake the coastal cities and towns, rumbling upwards into the night sky. India’s Space Research Organization would, after years of quiet diligence, conduct their first test flight of their crew vehicle, Gaganyaan. The GSLV Mark III vehicle had flown numerous government and commercial missions beforehand, a crucial test of a system designed to ultimately carry humans into space - the fifth nation to do so independently. For the crew of Athena, it was one of the greatest unifiers of them all - watching a blossoming space power come to light, ready to carry all of humanity into the next great frontier. Together.</span></p>

To those who build with their hands, the retirement of a tool is not something taken lightly. It is the end of the line for a companion, a piece of oneself that had been there throughout an entire project. As <i>Atlantis</i> would cast off for the last time from Gateway, there seemed to be a moment of kinship between the two machines, a moment of deep reflection for all who served with her. She had been known as the Assembler, bringing component after component to Odyssey, the MTV fleet, Gateway, Athena, Horizon and more, launching countless missions to far away places. While she was not the fleet leader, she had been there for longer than anyone could remember, lending bits and pieces of herself to every aspect of modern human spaceflight. She had given everything, bits and pieces time and time again to be the workhorse she needed to be. Soon, the great solar wings of Gateway would fade from view, prepping once again to receive another MTV for pre-departure processing. It had been a long time coming, and the number of flights remaining in the program now sat at 1. The countdown to retirement of a ship that had powered the minds of nearly two generations was approach its final moments, and as the good ship <i>Atlantis</i> would place her wheels on the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center for the last time, the eyes of spaceflight enthusiasts would turn to <i>Endeavour</i>. It was <i>Endeavour</i> who would fly last, set for one last rotation flight to Horizon to deliver an external servicing platform. Her flight was originally slated to be second to last, with one more Launch on Need mission scheduled if the program would require it. It was ultimately moved to Venturestar, and on September 16th, 2021, STS-259 would lift off from Pad 39A, the final ride in a journey of over 40 years. Her four person crew, all veteran fliers, called out their roll program as they assumed the proper attitude for flight, the last time the Shuttle’s wings would grace the skies. As the external tank was spent, and <i>Endeavour</i> cast herself free one final time, there would be a moment across the world where they knew something profound had ended. Sure, Jupiter-OPAV would continue the dream, building off the legacy of the orbiters and moving cargo into space, but there was something truly special about the power these living breathing creatures possessed. Horizon would see her arrive nearly two days after launch, the final transit of this magnificent creature across the cosmos, her journey nearly over. For the next week, there was some sense of normalcy, a Shuttle crew on station with both Liberté and ACEV <i>Kitty Hawk</i> brought the total complement to 18, but the station never felt crowded due to its sheer size. The crew onboard the station consisted largely of rookies, novice fliers who may have never even got the chance to step foot on Shuttle, and many of them found themselves floating through her decks, learning what they could before she became a museum piece. Her dials and switches were so… antiquated compared to the touchscreens and OLED displays of newer spacecraft, yet somehow so familiar. After 11 days of joint operations, for the final time, Shuttle would cast off from her destination in space, ready at last to bring her journey to an end. Her departure, captured from her own fading cameras and the station’s high quality hardware, would be watched by hundreds of thousands around the world, and the NASA WB-57s hooked up with a special connection to stream her entry live. As she streaked over the continental US, her plasma trail would be visible to hundreds of thousands. Like the Spot the Fleet campaign of old, one last celebration was held for a landing orbiter. Her double sonic booms, a telltale announcement of her arrival, broke the early evening silence in Florida. With grace, and the roar of jets overhead, <i>Endeavour</i> would place her wheels on the ground. For the final time, a shuttle sat at the end of the runway, a squadron of vehicles racing towards it. The air was thick with excitement, but also cut by the pain of loss, this great vehicle that had pushed humanity forward had served its purpose, and was ready for its long deserved rest. <i>Challenger, Discovery, Valiant, Atlantis, Endeavour</i> and <i>Intrepid</i> had done their job, and they had done it well.   <br>

Chris Taylor walked quickly down the hallways of Johnson, checking his watch. His pulse was up, Anna had phoned him about two hours ago about something important, something that couldn’t wait for much longer. She had given him no further indication of what it was, but… Here goes nothing. It was late in the day, many folks had gone home and the security guards that were left roaming the halls saluted him awkwardly as he walked by. He didn’t care. Set after set of double doors stood in between him and whatever it was she had for him. After several more turns, the doors sat in front of him. A conference room, one meant for Olympus prime and backup crew briefings… The very same room he had been briefed in all those years for Olympus 9. He tried to put it out of his mind, adjusted his suit, and stepped through the doors. Anna, Todd Mitchell, and several other engineers stood from their table, welcoming him with firm handshakes and in Anna’s case, a gentle hug. She was always more gentle. The usual pleasantries were made, and soon, everyone had taken their seats. Anna stood at the front of the room, and began her presentation. “Gentlemen, after months of consideration and careful analysis, we have come to the conclusion that our MTV fleet may soon no longer be fit for continued use in Martian operations. <i>Selene</i> may have longer than the others, but <i>Minerva</i> and <i>Prometheus</i> may soon be sidelined. We, of course have planned for this - the design of the soon to start construction MTV Mark 2, with upgraded engines and a fully reusable architecture, but we are left with the conundrum of what to do with the remainder of our fleet….” The room shifted, and Chris shot a look across at Todd, who only smiled. Anna continued, eyes turning back to the screen-wall, “Myself and several engineers have been wondering about what, in the interest of utilizing our architecture that exists, we could do with these fine ships? And so we turn to our nearest celestial neighbor. We’ve called this proposal Olympus-M, and it would see the three Mark 1 MTVs converted into ferries for an ACEV crew and cargo, and a substantial lander to a prepositioned habitat on the surface near Shackleton Crater… They’d ditch the drop tanks, of course, get a minor propulsion refit, and be able to deploy up to 2 vehicles at a time on a sortie. An international Lunar and Martian base… Now that’s exciting. We think we can do it before 2030, and there are those in Congress who would be willing to see us utilize equipment to its full potential…” Taylor sat straighter, feeling eyes on him, and opened his mouth to speak, unsure of where exactly this was taking all of them. Anna was one step ahead of him. “Now, I know what you’re thinking Chris, why am I here? Well, there is no one I trust more to lead this program and our continued development on the Martian surface than you… In short. Would you like to get a chance to finally walk on another world… A date with Destiny?” </span></p>
