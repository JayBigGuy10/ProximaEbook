  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">1</span><span class="calibre6">981 saw a rapid expansion to many aspects of NASA’s mission, as engineers and specialists worked to not only turn <i>Challenger</i> and <i>Discovery</i> around, but prepare for the third orbiter in their fleet. OV-104, <i>Atlantis</i>, was rolled out of the Rockwell Palmdale facility in late January and made her debut flight to Skylab soon after, now augmented with additional power and improved life support racks installed in the Orbital Workshop. Work done by <i>Discovery</i> and <i>Challenger</i> the previous year had improved conditions somewhat on the aging space station, but it was never optimal to begin with. The planned extension to Skylab’s liveable volume had not come to fruition; frustrating those who wished to expand the facility into a permanent destination for the Space Shuttle. Moreover, the new Extravehicular Mobility Units were too cumbersome to operate from Skylab's own airlock, adding time to spacewalks to augment the station. Mission planners had made the unpleasant call to merely “crew-tend” Skylab, and install experiments that could be left running - returning periodically to check the results. These included microbiology, solar physics and more, with the increased electrical power resulting in more systems that could be run. During the station’s Apollo era, the damaged solar array had severely limited how functional the station was in a scientific capacity. It was, in many ways, disappointing to those who had advocated for Skylab’s return to service as a US outpost in orbit, but Skylab was what it was, and there was only so much work that could be done. These rotating crew flights were bookended by free flights of the orbiter system, working to deploy the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System and a series of small and medium class Earth science missions for NASA, as well as new, joint operations with the European Space Agency in their Spacelab program.</span></p><br/>

The 3 orbiters of the fleet found themselves busy, but it became apparent rather quickly that Skylab would not be a permanent destination. Problems cropped up on nearly every flight to the station, and it was becoming clear that Skylab had its fair share of shortcomings. The most notable incident occurred on the 6th visit by a shuttle crew, the first with an international crew member from Europe, when a small fire in an experiment rack forced the crew back to <i>Atlantis</i> out of an abundance of caution. The crew, understandably stunned from what had happened, spent the remainder of their time on orbit troubleshooting the station, and once again venting the life support system and recycling the breathing gas onboard the station. Skylab was looking less and less like a simply malfunctioning space station, and more like a hazard. NASA management was quick to highlight the sustainability of operations from a station that had not had the best start to begin with. In early September of 1981, the last flight to Skylab took place, powering down the station and removing essential equipment and mementos. Skylab was a shell of its former self, showing considerable age even in the nearly two years of crew operations with the shuttle. The crew would undock, and a Skylab De-Orbit module, not unlike the vehicle that had saved it years ago, would take the orbiter’s place to deorbit the once great station. Skylab, after a nearly 8 year service life, re-entered over the South Pacific on September 30th, 1981, and met an honorable end. Shuttle flights carried on throughout the year, and new records continued to be set for endurance, crew size and altitude. The vehicle was performing better than expected, and already the Shuttle was becoming a symbol of American aerospace excellence.<br/>
<br/>
In the immediate “post-Skylab period”, mission planners were eager to test the system’s capabilities even further, and develop techniques that could help with future activities in space. Shuttle had been used previously as a launch platform for satellites, but one of the systems’ main selling points was the ability to service satellites and assist in construction in space. Launching mid-morning on October 3rd, 1981, STS-11 would demonstrate the capability of Shuttle to service satellites. <i>Challenger</i> would open her payload bay doors and assume the proper attitude for flight, after a flawless 8 ½ minute ride to orbit. This would also mark the system’s first flight with seven crew members, a record number of people in space on one spacecraft. The mission’s target would be a recently launched vehicle, the first of NASA’s spin stabilized <i>Geostationary Global Observers</i>. Meant as an interim vehicle while planned upgrades to the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite were in development, the GGO program was capable in its own right. These vehicles, based off of a commercial satellite bus, would provide NASA with coverage of the entire globe’s weather patterns through continuous observation and imaging at geostationary altitudes. GGO-1, launched in May of 1981, had failed to achieve its intended orbit due to a kick stage failure, leaving the vehicle stranded. Rather than abandon the satellite, NASA saw an opportunity to test the mettle of both the shuttle and the crew and validate many of the design choices made in the development of the orbiters. Flight Day 2 saw the first phase of approach to the stricken satellite, and the beginnings of prep work for the complex series of EVAs required to fix it. The plan, notionally, was to retrieve the satellite using the Canadian Remote Manipulator System, secure it in the payload bay, and attach a new, non-faulty kick motor that would enable the satellite to get on its way. A series of 3 EVAs was planned, the first would be to secure the satellite, and bring it to the payload bay. The following 2 EVAs would concentrate on installing the new motor and performing final checkouts, as well as evaluating multiple types of tools for astronaut use and assembly of a testbed structure in the cargo bay.<br/>
<br/>
This would not be as easy as they anticipated. The maneuvering of the orbiter, and the first step: grappling the vehicle, was fairly easy. The capture bar, designed to fit exactly within the propulsion segment of the vehicle, worked exactly as intended, and soon, GGO-1 was secure in the cargo bay. This is where the problems began. The second EVA began, and the crewmembers soon discovered that the mounting point for the new apogee motor had been damaged during the separation from the failed upper stage on it’s original launch vehicle. This meant that the planned installation would have to wait, as teams on the ground worked to remedy the situation. The new Extravehicular Mobility Units proved to be a difficult learning curve in space, as the Neutral Buoyancy Lab could only replicate so much about the conditions in orbit. The astronauts were growing tired quickly, and flight controllers had to ensure they were not too fatigued to continue servicing the satellite. A plan was quickly drawn up to pry the old mounting plate off with the inflight equivalent of a crowbar, and replace it with a spare that had been sent up with the crew. This too proved arduous, as the suits did not lend themselves well to the motion required to remove the screws. On hour 6 of spacewalk 2, the old mounting plate was off and stowed, and the new plate moved into position. This proved to be far easier, as ground controllers made the decision to move the satellite with the RMS over the middle of the payload bay to allow for installation of the new mounting plate. With hour 7 rolling around, the call was made to cut the spacewalk, and cancel the tasks for spacewalk 3 in favor of finishing the job. The third EVA would proceed much more smoothly, with the astronauts getting the new kick stage attached in roughly 6 hours, and releasing the satellite promptly.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the mission was fairly mundane, but the crew did manage to spend some time observing the Earth and talking to the press. The, understandably tired, crew gave a tour of the orbiter, showing off their flips in microgravity, and discussed the learning curve of their arduous spacewalks. The public simply couldn’t get enough - astronauts were becoming commonplace, and soon, perhaps even private citizens could fly to space and experience its majesty. The notion of repairing and servicing things in space, once a science fiction dream, was now possible with a vehicle like the Space Shuttle. Futurists, economists, scientists and engineers could now envision a world in which routine access to space would drastically improve life on Earth; perhaps bringing about a reality that was better than the one they lived in. The Space Shuttle featured prominently in media, soon transcending the realm of space launch system and becoming something of a cultural icon. At this time, NASA began to consider an option for their next astronaut class; the inclusion of <i>non-scientists</i> as potential astronauts. They did not have to be test pilots or hold doctorates in their field, but could be educators, artists or social scientists. NASA felt, and many within the astronaut corps reflected this, that if the Space Shuttle was to bring humans forward to the stars, than it needed to represent <i>all</i> of humanity. As an added bonus, a dedicated "Educator Astronaut" corps would ensure that human spaceflight accomplishments would remain in the public eye. It seemed that the overseas partners would agree, and would take similar action in public outreach. The path was laid, with NASA, their newfound international collaborators and crews headed for greatness. The road to the cosmos, a road so many had dreamt of for years, seemed to be finally open to humankind.<br/>
<br/>
The question however still remained, where to? To some groups, there seemed only one logical option, one that would be reiterated by NASA’s various offices - Mars. Internally, it seemed very clear that the agency would move forward with a Mars focused program, and questions waiting to be answered from Mariner and Viking loomed large. Politically, the support was there, as the shuttle program had only expanded the contributions of various districts across the country. The will of the American people was with NASA, and many within the public sphere had hoped for a mission to Mars by 1980 with Apollo technology. Even though the Space Shuttle, kept NASA in low earth orbit for now, there was a consensus that <i>more</i> could be done. The people of the world looked to images of space as the next great frontier to explore. To get there, however, would require planning, and very quietly, requests for proposals were sent to contractors across the industry. Agencies around the world, many of them lifting their first crews to space on board the Shuttle such as Europe, Canada and Japan, would also show an interest in large scale political participation. It soon became clear that a mission of this scale would not be feasible alone, and that there were some unlikely connections that needed to be made. </span></p>
