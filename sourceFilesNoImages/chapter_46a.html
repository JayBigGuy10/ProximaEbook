  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">When I began this project, I did not think it would blossom into the work that it did. When I published my first chapter on November 15, 2021, I was so unsure of what was to come, and so nervous about whether anyone at all would read this work - but my expectations were more than exceeded. Proxima has become something I am immensely proud of, and while it has not always pleased everyone, I am so grateful that it has made a difference for at least some folks, and inspired people to pursue their own exploration of alternate history. While this is our last chapter of the story, there will be one more crucial piece coming very soon that I am very excited about, I cannot wait to share what I have in store. I will also be doing a Proxima: Best Of art post in the coming weeks, and I encourage folks to ask tons of questions in the interim. I want to give a huge shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/salyutseven" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ben</a>, who did the two tracks for today's chapter which you can listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/Mc8jyB8XNMg" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/kQRiSxPaIVY" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a>, and take a moment to thank the countless people who have helped make this project a reality - so much of this world has come to life as a result of their contributions. Thank you all for joining me, I will see you in the Epilogue, and I can't wait for what's on the Horizon.</span></p>
