  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">E</span><span class="calibre6">xpedition 1, the first expedition to Horizon, had proceeded better than anyone had hoped. Anna had spent countless hours onboard Horizon, supervising construction and expansion as Expedition 1 wrapped up - yet barely had any time to reflect on the excitement of it all. The station had been a hive of activity, hustling and bustling as cargo ships arrived and departed, and crews ventured out to install equipment across the station. The primary crew of 6 had been visited for a two week handover by a Euro-Russian crew onboard Liberté bringing the station’s crew up to 10 for the first time, something the Station Office planned to make permanent by Expedition 3, and later up to 12 for a baseline once the ACEV vehicle was online. Some quirks of space station living were already starting to bleed into the young station, a corner of the “Supermodule” core had been colloquially dubbed the Reading Room, with a small supply of books building up inside one of the racks that had not yet been filled. The windows lining the module would be another popular destination for crews, providing breathtaking views of the planet below them. Commander Douglass had been pleased to instruct the newcomers on her crew about the time old tradition of Dude Darts, taking advantage of the cavernous core module of the station to fling their fellow astronauts towards a target, felt tipped pen in hand. It had been a rather productive expedition, with the crew delivering talks to the public of the advantages of this new, bigger facility in orbit. Some of the more exciting tests conducted work on 3D printing structures and metallurgy, a key factor in ensuring that humans could assemble and work with structures off Earth. It had been a productive expedition, and the crew felt proud to be the first. Anna had been particularly touched by the honor of being the first to fly - there was a great deal of trust that had been placed in her to command this crew and lead humanity well into the 21st century of spaceflight. She had even made it out on EVA, traversing across the great core module to install a small star tracking telescope on the Power Tower. She found herself, in the rare quiet moments outside, staring back at the Earth, and missing the feeling of the Florida sun at twilight. After 199 days in orbit, Space Shuttle <i>Discovery</i> would launch with the next rotation crew, Expedition 2, which would temporarily bring the station’s crew to 14. As <i>Discovery</i> would come to rest at the forward port, and the crews would embrace, the station would still not feel crowded as Odyssey or the MTVs had - it was truly an expansive port to the stars. After a week of handover operations, the crew of Expedition 1 would board the orbiter, and undock from the mammoth complex, drifting away ever so slowly. Anna would press her face to the glass, as she had done as she drifted away from the MTV for the first time, and wondered where this great machine would take them next. </span></p>

Horizon had demonstrated that this new form of construction had been ultimately successful, and plans for the use of such components only increased in number. The most prominent use for the use of 8.4 meter tankage was the core module of Foundation, the Martian central base, planned to touch down in Noctis Landing alongside the Olympus 15 mission for setup. The base was to be the start of a long and sustainable career on the Martian surface. Sharon Kensworth, the Commander of the Olympus 6 mission had been brought on as the technical head at Boeing for the construction of the base module, citing her previous experience on the Martian surface and interest in interior design. The Core Module for Foundation would not be nearly as large as the core module onboard Horizon, but would take advantage of its unique modular deck structure to be arranged however the crews onboard needed it. It would be split into 3 main decks: Deck 1, which would contain all of the workshops, equipment stores, and connections to other modules. It would be the most utilitarian of all the levels, mainly focused on engineering and operations. Deck 2 would be the galley, some living space, and the labs. The lab spaces onboard would be split into 3 distinct areas - life science, geophysical sciences, and a bonus space that could double as a medical wing. Deck 3 would be the living space, centered around a common area which was designed to ensure calm and collaboration. It contained a small lounge, which could be converted to a formal “dining room” for special events, a recreation room, two bathroom facilities, and 8 bunks, which offered a degree of privacy from the rest of the crew. These facilities would all flank the central core of the module, which contained the communications command center - a nexus point of vital information for the crew’s mission. The challenge however, still remained how to get the thing onto the surface, and ensure that the crew could make use of the facilities present through repeated access to the planet. To enable the base to land on the surface, they would make use of a series of landing assistance technologies, the first being an inflatable heat shield, derived from technology used to recover Atlas and Helios engine pods. This would get them through the brunt of the heating, and the increased surface area would slow the module considerably. The next step would be four supersonic chutes, the largest ever deployed, to slow the base from supersonic velocity to subsonic. The final, and most crucial mode for descent, would come from the propulsion “puck” attached to the base of the spacecraft. This flat fuel tank and 6 distributed engines would slow the base to a hover over the designated landing site, before setting down and purging the fuel lines. The spring of 2016 would see the pressure vessel of the base completed, and the transfer element to support the base was staged in LEO in the start of summer, ready to accept the necessary tankers it would require in 2018, before heading to the Red Planet.<br>

The handoff period that was becoming so commonplace now for Olympus missions loomed large as the crew of O13 made their return to the Earth-Moon system. Their final few months on the surface had been exciting, their exploration of the Phlegra Montes region had included a 4 meter drill experiment that had produced rather interesting sediment cores for their return to Earth. It had been the hope that this type of drilling would return evidence of liquid water aquifers below the surface, to no avail. This was certainly disappointing, but this region was one of many yet to be explored across the Martian surface. The crew had made use of their new rotorcraft, one of which was unfortunately lost to the lava tubes during the approach to one of the veins of the mountain range. Other experiments included solar radiation experiments, and technology demonstrations of base building equipment. Their return to orbit was textbook, and as the crew departed, they would find themselves eager to rest for the long journey home. The departure from the Red Planet was carried out without issue, and just when the crew thought they could get away with a problem free mission, a warning cropped up on their GAIA system. The primary rotary joint on the port solar array had failed, and the crew could not activate its backup. Remembering the issues faced during the Olympus 9 mission, and under careful advice from mission control, three crew members suited up to step outside and tackle the problem. The spacewalk was carried out with a slow, delicate precision, gentle steps forward with constant glove and helmet checks. For those on the ground, still victim to light delays at their most extreme, it was one of the most tense moments of the mission, a nail biting reminder of the sheer fragility of the whole operation. After 6 and a half hours outside, the crew was able to get the solar array rotating again, and the folks on the ground could once again breathe easy. The rest of their return was ultimately successful, and soon, the next crew could get on their way - with an even more daring mission in mind. The Olympus 14 crew, setting out for the Red Planet onboard <i>Prometheus</i>, would see a slightly shorter than normal stay on the surface, closer to 300 days rather than the notional 450. The truncation in their mission would see the crew return to the Base Station to refit their lander, <i>Taurus</i>, with the necessary equipment to rendezvous with Phobos, Mars’ larger moon. The return of the crew to the Base Station would enable them to gather the necessary supplies, and prepare the lander’s upper stage for the approach and rendezvous phase. <i>Prometheus</i>, before their departure, had been outfitted with a series of work surfaces and cranes that would be carried with the vehicle to the Base Station, and ultimately loaded on the lander for the voyage to the moon. It was viewed by many as a new and daring direction, and insider circles wondered if it was a move to start scouting the asteroid-moon for resources. Under the command of ESA’s Samuel Bianchi, the crew of Olympus 14 would head for their MTV in the later half of the year, with their eyes set on the strange new worlds they would encounter. </span></p>

In Florida, at Launch Complex 36, a new beast sat ready for flight, her ports and orifices snarling and wheezing as she was filled with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Technicians had long evacuated the pad, fearing what might happen if some problem might occur. She had been moved onto the launchpad three days ago, sliding along a slick tracked rail system from her gargantuan nest of a hangar. Several hundred curious onlookers had gathered at Playalinda Beach, marveling at this strange and seemingly otherworldly shape as it was erected on the pad. The first orbital flight of Venturestar, VS01 <i>Sabre</i>, was mere hours away - with the first production vehicle ready to deploy a payload for the United States Air Force. Tucked ever so delicately within her cargo bay was a fairly large payload, roughly the size of a geostationary communications satellite, but with no upper stage - not that Venturestar could carry too much more. Instead, a tug, designed to work in tandem with both Raven and Venturestar - delivering payloads to a variety of orbits around Earth, ready to spread her wings and take to the skies. This vehicle, <i>Sunjammer</i>, was a solar electric tug, designed for months if not years of operations in a variety of harsh environments. For the team, this was a momentous occasion, and one that could not come soon enough. Their competitor, Raven, had flown four times since <i>Sabre</i> had started construction, much to Lockheed’s chagrin. Even getting the vehicle to the pad had been a challenge, logistics issues had hampered final assembly in Florida, and delays in shipping had meant critical components for the reaction control system had not been installed until 4 days before rollout. Thunderstorms had delayed the initial launch, forcing the team to wait out the storm on the pad before the vehicle could proceed, finally, on April 6th, 2016. Like a great beast, the vehicle roared to life, sequentially lighting its XRS-2200 aerospikes as it ramped up in power. Soon, the hold down clamps would be released, and the gargantuan spacecraft would lumber off the pad, steam from the sound suppression water system wrapping it for a moment in a misty veil. Like the Shuttle before it, the vehicle would soon roll to a heads down, wings level position - slicing through the ever thinning atmosphere. As it climbed and the atmosphere faded to a wispy blue and then black, the vehicle could flex its strength, before finally shutting down its 7 main engines, coasting through its first orbit. Soon, the payload bay of the great vehicle would open, and the Canadian built robotic arm could move to delicately extract its cargo from the interior of the vehicle. Ever so carefully, the arm would latch onto the tug, pulling it from the belly of the spacecraft, and allowing it to unfold its great solar arrays. Engineering cameras would document the deployment of the spacecraft as it spread its wings, tracking the sun to generate power. After all was confirmed successful, the great winged beasts would part ways, and <i>Sunjammer</i> would pulse her RCS to move her away, ready to begin a long and storied service life. Soon, it became Venturestar’s turn to come home, diving into the atmosphere to return from whence it came. Like her predecessor, she would sweep through the atmosphere in long, slow turns that would help her bleed off speed. As the double sonic booms pierced the Florida coast, those within the shuttle program knew that a successor for LEO cargo was within their grasp, a well deserved continuation of cargo services to a wide variety of destinations. For the Venturestar team, Flight 1 was the first of many steps, steps that would carry humanity into an age of fully reusable cargo flight to LEO.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new'">“This is CNN Breaking News - after a long stand down, the China National Space Administration has launched a new Shenzhou ferry to their spacecraft, Baochuán. The presumed crew of 3 lifted off approximately 6 hours ago, and has appeared to dock with the complex, including the newly launched transfer stage. Whether China will attempt another Lunar flyby or something more ambitious is not yet known - the 18th Space Control Squadron has promised to share updates when appropriate. Stick with us tonight, and join us in discussion with our panel of experts to ponder this latest development in what is shaping up to be a dynamic moment in space exploration history...” </span><br>

<div style="text-align: center">— — — — — — — —</div><br>
In Low Earth Orbit, the crew of the newly docked Shenzhou were getting acquainted with their vehicle. Baochuán-1, the last crew to fly out of LEO onboard this ship, had left few reminders that they had ever been there, ensuring that the spacecraft remained pristine for whatever came after it. The spacecraft had separated from the Tianyu station about 4 days prior, and had done a thorough internal review of its systems. Liu Guangfu, the commander, had given the ship a thorough once over, ensuring that everything was where it needed to be for their mission to asteroid 2003 TK9. <i> Funny</i>, he thought to himself, <i>the first human mission to an asteroid, and they didn’t pick one with a proper name.</i> His two crewmates, both fighter pilots like he had been, were moving equipment out of their Shenzhou, which had been packed to the brim with additional equipment. They were carrying out the majority of unloading and setup, giving him the captain’s honor of inspection - a naval tradition that had bled into human spaceflight. Mission control had been eager to get them off the ground, high winds had nearly caused a scrub, and the window to intercept the asteroid had been short. Outside, tensioning cables began to secure the solar panels for the upcoming maneuver, courtesy of the extended upper stage docked to the aft of the spacecraft. Fei Wang, Mission Specialist 1, swung into the foot restraints beside the commander, letting him know that everything was secure, and the ship was ready for their first projected departure window. <i>Time to go already…</i> the commander thought, moving towards the docking compartment, where Mission Specialist 2, Wang Xuhze was already suiting up in his Russian derived Sokol suit. The hatch between the main spacecraft and the Shenzhou would soon be closed, and the 3 taikonauts would strap into their launch and entry couches once again, ready in the event something unexpected happened. As the crew settled in, they would receive their final confirmation that all was go to proceed from mission control, and salute the small camera that hung in the corner of the orbital module - a tradition carried out on bold Chinese spaceflight endeavors before. As the power of their kickstage pressed their bodies against their restraints, and the RCS quads on the outside of the ship barked and huffed, they would miss something crucial. Somewhere, deep within the bowels of the veteran spacecraft, something would give. A component would slip out of place, a circuit would be broken, a fault too small for even the spacecraft’s complicated computer brain to notice. The crew would not notice either, and no alarms would cause the crew to consider aborting their burn. They would press on - determined to make history, determined to reach their not too distant star. With a thunk, the kickstage would burnout and separate, and the crew of Baochuán-3 could begin to settle in for their voyage, unaware of what lay lurking within. </span></p>
