  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">A</span><span class="calibre6">s <i>Challenger</i>, the fleet leader, lifted off for a servicing mission to Gateway, it became clear that the next phase of NASA’s crewed spacecraft and station systems would need to arrive soon. The orbiters were doing fine, but they were aging, and the advancements across the aerospace sector indicated a trend towards crew vehicles that could stay in space for a long period of time. The shuttle fleet was useful, they could be turned around fairly quickly, but they could not support long term operations in orbit. As cargo had started to move to other vehicles, such as Cygnus, ATV and HTV, the idea of a dedicated crew vehicle that could fit multiple roles began to enter the minds of NASA and their partners. ESA had remarkable success with their crewed lifting body program, and NASA had begun to take notice. The work leveraged on the Shuttle program had showcased the importance of alternate landing sites, and the advantage of a winged vehicle - but stressed the importance of a launch abort system that could carry the crew to safety in the event of an emergency. For NASA, the age of the Shuttle was a reality check, there needed to be a vehicle that could support all of the things that the agency had in mind for the future. Ultimately, the requirements for the vehicle would be broken down into several components. The first, multirole capability, would ensure that the vehicle could plug and play with the multitudes of activities NASA had in mind. For LEO operations, the vehicle should be able to plug and play with the variety of stations already in or planned to be in orbit. It should also be able to interface with a variety of service modules, enabling multiple mission roles extending from lifeboat on station or MTV to long range independent crew vehicle. The final consideration would be landing site options, with a winged or biconic vehicle preferred for on ground recovery. With all of this in mind, NASA began to look at partners for this new American spacecraft - the Advanced Crew Exploration Vehicle. Multiple partner corporations would come forward, and look to propose their designs for the future of human spaceflight. Lockheed, the immediate front runner, would propose a capsule, leveraging thermal protection system work on both the Shuttle and X-33/Venturestar programs, with a multirole orbital module that could be tacked on later for missions to Near Earth Objects, and other roles including Lunar exploration. Boeing would also submit a simpler capsule + service module design, equipped with a Soyuz-like mission module that the vehicle would launch with - also compatible with multiple different service modules for a variety of roles. Northrop Grumman would propose a biconic lifting body, combining a variety of mission modules, and stressing the capability to launch on commercially available launch vehicles - a major step in reducing launch cost. Work would start quietly on the whittling down of the frontrunners, and the countdown to Shuttle retirement could begin.<br>

At the Cape, the <i>Pegasus</i> barge pulled into port, carrying with it the future of human habitation in space. The Large Diameter Modular Station Core, fresh from the factory, sat at the doorstep of the Space Station Processing Facility. Inside, she was fitted out with the latest equipment to ensure that all its crews were both comfortable and productive in their quest to further scientific knowledge in space. She also bore a name - Horizon. While arriving at the launch site was one thing, final checkout was another, a lot of steps needed to happen between arrival and liftoff. Her 8.4 meter diameter core presented a challenge, it was the largest single module ever processed by the facility, even larger than Skylab’s 6.7 meters. As the space station was rolled into the facility, and work crews began to tinker away and finalize the vehicle for launch, a familiar face would stand outside the Vehicle Assembly Building - Commander Douglass, to give remarks as to the nature of the program. Since her work recovering the Olympus 9 crew, she had taken her spot as senior in the astronaut office, but quietly longed for the feeling of weightlessness again. Her rotation to Mars had disqualified her from flying to the Red Planet again, due to radiation concerns, but she had remained a cornerstone figure in the Human Spaceflight Office. And today, she stood ready to take the lead once again. Addressing the gathered crowd, she'd deliver her remarks: “Ladies and gentlemen, good morning - today is a really spectacular day, we have a piece of hardware here that I’m so excited to get to work on.Over the last 20 years, at NASA and in cooperation with our partners, we have developed some of the most exotic and cutting edge technologies that have pushed us into a new era of human history. We regularly walk on the surface of Mars, and have even begun to think about going further. I am honored to be a part of that process, and I look forward to seeing how stations like Horizon will open the doors for not just an elite few to experience spaceflight. Onboard this grand station, we invite those from all over the world, from old and new partners, to participate in science, anthropology, cultural analysis and more, to ensure humans are prepared for the next giant leap - permanent human habitation in space. I am more than honored to have the chance to command Horizon Expedition 1, launching next year. It’s a great moment to fly again, and I can’t wait to share the view from orbit with all of you.” As Anna stepped off the podium, she felt her heartbeat in her ears, just as she had felt it when she gave her press conference for Olympus 3. Commanding a mission was an honor for sure, and privately, she had wondered if she would get the chance again. As she looked up at the VAB, and out to the pad at 39A, she began to ponder her role as a leader, ready to take command and lead a team one more time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
In orbit of Mars, the crew of Olympus 12 began the final steps to leave the Base Station, and head for the Martian surface. <i>Selene</i>, the latest MTV to be launched, had performed exceptionally - all the hard work that had gone into her was not for nothing, her computer guidance system had faithfully gotten them to the Red Planet, with minimal teething issues, to be expected of a new MTV. Their lander, <i>Hydra</i>, had been stocked with equipment for landing in the northeastern region of Syrtis, a volcanic shield region that had been relatively unexplored. They would be joined by a new pressurized rover, Chariot, which had been prepositioned with their supplies. Descent to the surface, after <i>Hydra</i> had separated from the Base Station, had been delayed a day as the crew worked to check out their lander, and shelter from a micrometeoroid storm that had been detected in higher orbits by relay satellites. Nikita Borisov, the lander pilot, had remarked that the extra time in space had helped him calm his nerves prior to the landing. Entry and descent occurred nominally after their delay, setting them down within a mile of the intended landing site, the new camera mast onboard Chariot tracking them as they covered their final few feet to the surface. The site was unique, the highest elevation landing site by far, requiring additional propellant on the part of the descent stage, cutting into their reserves slightly. It was of no concern, however, as the flight computer aided Borisov in his landing attempt. With a dull thud, the crew of 8 had successfully landed on Mars, and work to begin converting their lander into a base could begin. Conversion, for the long stay class missions, was always the most strenuous part of the stay on the surface - the added stress of acclimation notwithstanding. It would take several days before the first crew to reposition modules, consisting of ESA Commander Jean Luc Baptiste, NASA’s Anthony Zuckow and JAXA’s Yuri Nakayama could get outside and begin to move components into place. After four days of grueling EVAs, their basecamp would be setup, and after a week, the internal volume of the descent stage would be converted into their home away from home, ready to begin. Some of the first mission priorities would be the checkout of their rover, Chariot. Based on the immensely successful Argonaut, the rover had ample room for long duration missions, one of the goals of the mission. Olympus 4 had spent a decent amount of time in this Isdis Planitia region, not too far from the Olympus 12 landing site, but had been restricted in their mobility by the lack of a pressurized rover. It was the hope of the crew that they would get the chance to visit the landing site of Olympus 4, and conduct something of an archeological dig - investigating how the vehicle and equipment had held up after all these years on the surface.  However, weather conditions were potentially too adverse to make the journey.  The priority remained firmly geologically focused - scaling the Syrtis region and uncovering its mysteries. The first sortie outside of the range of the base would see a crew of 3 take Chariot to the foothills of Syrtis, examining what seemed to resemble runoff basins. Yulia Akinshina, Karen Tillman and Tomas Gerstmaeir would lead this expedition, voyaging around the great shifting sand dunes to explore the foothills. For the Olympus 12 crew, and for controllers on the ground, the program was back in the swing of things, pushing faster and higher and living up to its true potential.</span></p>

In LEO, a shape loomed close to the limb of the Earth, as observed by the crew of Odyssey. Slowly, it came closer, and the crew could make out a large pair of solar array wings, and the hazy blue glow of an ion thruster. Gateway was at last completing its journey to the veteran station, ready to begin a complex process of reorganization. Several of the modules onboard Odyssey were more than functional, and it was decided by the partners who assembled her that some pieces would live on when Horizon was launched next year. With this, space station planners had elected to be bold, and use Gateway to collect modules that would still be useful. This would include the Permanent Multipurpose Logistics Module, what functionally consisted of a closet and storage space, and the Copernicus laboratory provided by Europe. These modules, the youngest on station, would be used to temporarily store experiments and supplies to be installed onboard Horizon. As the transient spacecraft came closer, she would begin the process of lining up for docking, the first time two independent space stations had ever docked with each other. Ever so delicately, the two PMAs would make contact, and the pressure between them would equalize. Work could begin, truly the start of the end for Odyssey. As the crew onboard worked, they would remember fondly how the station had developed, for so long a backbone of operations of the international spaceflight community. The station had its fair share of problems, modules were aging, sure, but an Odyssey rotation was the usual first stop for astronauts training for Mars. As the crews onboard would finish packing both the PMLM and Copernicus, they would remove essential items, safety equipment and the likes, as well as a crucial item - a flag. The flag had been flown to the station in the wake of the Valiant disaster, and served as a makeshift memorial for the crew, finally giving them their place in orbit. As Gateway collected the two modules, the station would creak and groan, awakened from years of stability, as if she knew this was near the end. After 26 days of combined operations, Gateway would undock and begin to back away, the last spacecraft to be assembled and worked on at the legendary complex. Gateway would once again fire her engines, and start the push back to her home orbit, awaiting the future, while reflecting on a storied past.<br>

At Edwards, a new type of creature was rolled to the pad. Venturestar’s baby brother, X-33, stood tall at its rather diminutive launch site in the California desert, a stark contrast to the complexity on the East and West coast. Final assembly had proceeded fairly smoothly, after working around several of the issues pertaining to weight. Compromises had been made, notably at the joints of the tanks, where lightweight alloys had filled the role of composites. It had ultimately resulted in a payload hit, something the Air Force was decidedly unhappy with, but the testing would continue, and they’d do what they could to ensure that the vehicle they ultimately delivered would be worth the weight and considerable financial investment. The vehicle was very similar to its forebearer, the shuttle, in a lot of ways - exotic thermal protection system, hydrolox powered, spaceplane shape for entry, but more modernized. Weather on the first day of the planned launch had been unpredictable, shifting winds had complicated matters, and smoke from forest fires had drifted over the launch site, threatening to tamper with sensitive equipment. It had been an interesting time to watch this program blossom into existence, for sure. TAV had flown its penultimate flight, demand for launches was too low in the LEO environment to support the rapid turnaround that it had promised. The vehicle’s limited payload mass negated multi-launch architecture, something private corporations were looking for in deployment for LEO and MEO regimes. This was cause for… some concern for those on the Venturestar team, as no upper stages were currently planned for the vehicle, nor could one fit within the payload constraints of the augmented fuel tanks. Regardless, Venturestar would press on, and on the 15th of July, 2013, X-33 V01 would lift off from the pad, rising into the California sky and pitching over onto her back - nose aligning with the correct attitude for ascent. Her XRS-2200 main engine, one of seven planned for the operational Venturestar fleet, burned well as she climbed through 20,000 feet, shaking the landscape with a low crackle. As she pressed on towards her final height of 60 miles, she would fade from view, leaving only a trail of vapor. As she reached apoapsis, she would roll onto her belly, and begin the long, slow turns to bring her back to the runway. She had also set a speed record from Edwards, clocking in at Mach 13, and would now work to bleed that speed off - a carefully calculated process by the flight computer. As she slowly made her way to the landing site, what essentially amounted to a carefully controlled fall, the engineers working on her could forget for a moment that several key obstacles to orbital flight remained… <br>

Elsewhere in California, preliminary work on Phoenix had been full steam ahead. The next generation, reusable lander for the Olympus program, had been progressing well on schedule since work started nearly a year and a half ago. Much of the design had focused on reusing as many common elements from the MSAV as possible, while incorporating reuse elements into the lander design. Flight deck hardware was one of the first items brought over, as well as some of the tanking components. It was quickly realized that the landing profile of the original MSAV was not conducive to multiple landing sorties, something which would be required for the next phase of the Olympus program. With this in mind, a unique source of inspiration was sought out - supersonic aircraft frames. Mars was unique in that entry velocity from low orbit was not as damaging as say, Earth or Venus. Entry heating was roughly equivalent to the high supersonic range, so vehicles such as the SR-71 were studied as analogues for heating in this rather unusual environment. The SR-71, another Lockheed product, was studied closely, as the vehicle began to take shape. The switch from a retro-propulsive/ballute entry to an aero-assisted entry would, however, require a rethinking of the controls surfaces. Instead of the traditional speedbrakes used on the <i>Zephyr</i> class MSAV, the Phoenix class MADV would use a split wing design, extending out from the body like a science fiction rocket from the 1950s. These aero surfaces would assist in generating as much drag as possible, before the vehicle would reorient itself for its final landing burn on the JAXA/Mitsubishi provided LE-57M engines, a legacy product from the original lander. It soon became clear, however, that in order to support operations at Mars, the Base Station would need serious refitting, and a dedicated fleet of tankers that could support continued sorties on the surface. Tank structures would need to be converted to support liquid hydrogen and oxygen, and the tankers would most likely have to take advantage of hybrid propulsion mechanisms, such as solar electric propulsion. Such systems had been considered before, for the first wave of Olympus operations, but in the face of a new and revitalized approach, old concepts were prone to rising from the dead. </span></p>
