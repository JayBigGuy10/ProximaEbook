  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">I</span><span class="calibre6">n the sands of Kazakhstan, an American behemoth, coupled to a former-Soviet giant, trundled to the launch pad. It was something of an unusual sight, the black payload fairing sitting on the side of Energia’s tank structure looked otherworldly, and to an untrained eye, this vehicle would never fly in a straight line. But to an engineer? It was a marvel. The first Mars Surface Access Vehicle, built in pieces in Japan and California before final assembly at Baikonur, was truly representative of the years of international relations that lead up to this very moment. The wind had been calm enough to enable the rollout to the pad, and the great mechanical beast that was the Transporter-Erector. Soon, after careful checks of the system, the vehicle would be rotated to vertical at Site 110, the former home of the N1 rocket. Soon, the clamshell support structure of the facility would close around the lander and rocket. Great care was taken to ensure the vehicle would be successful on its ascent into space, joining MTV-2, <i>Prometheus</i>, in orbit for the flight of Olympus 2, the first full fledged test of the integrated system. The launch shook the nearby villages as the great vehicle roared skyward, early in the morning on February 10th, 1994. Pitching over, the vehicle continued to thunder skywards, jettisoning its Zenit boosters. Soon, the upper half of the payload fairing would release, revealing the lander within. The rocket, its job finished, would exhaust its fuel and eject the lander onto a suborbital trajectory, corrected by its onboard maneuvering engines. The lander loomed large in orbit, its launch visible from the Odyssey complex where <i>Prometheus</i> had been worked on. It, unlike its future siblings, was unpainted, revealing the gray cladding used in its construction - leading to its nickname: <i>Monitor</i>, after the Union battleship of similar stature.<br>
<br>
Fueling operations for <i>Monitor</i> proceeded largely as they had with the MTV on Olympus 1, repeat flights of the Jupiter-OPAV system had enabled a relatively painless fueling operation. The choice of cryogenics for the lander enabled relatively common tanking hardware across the system, and the well understood characteristics of cryo fuels were soon becoming something of second nature to the logistics teams. Continued refueling flights had also filled <i>Prometheus’</i> tanks, readying them for the crew of Olympus 2, and a Boeing Helios 5.4 vehicle had delivered the second lifeboat to the MTV. The vehicle had slipped free of the bonds of Odyssey in the previous year, and been checked out by two shuttle crews in preparation for the second test flight of the Olympus program. This test would see the whole system integrated, rendezvousing with the lander as well as the Mars Base Station, which had been in orbit since late 1991. The station had been visited by a number of Shuttle crews as it had been prepared for its departure to Mars, now scheduled for the end of 1994. Olympus 2 would see the MTV perform a series of high intensity maneuvers, simulating arrival around Mars, rendezvous with the base station, and rendezvous with the lander. The crew would then split up and perform a simulation of lander operations, and return to the waiting MTV-Station complex. <i>Intrepid</i>, on her second Olympus rotation, would roll out with her 11 person crew in April, launching on the 16th. Commanding this mission would be Shuttle veteran Johnathan Fisher, a transfer from the Air Force astronaut corps. Joining him would be Canadian MTV pilot Laurent St. Michel, American flight surgeon Dr. Nicholas Bonner as well as Russian mission specialist Ana Fyodorova. The lander pilot, ex-RAF Wing Commander Sharon Kensworth would be joined by Japan’s Kuro Okamura and Finland’s Terho Koniksen. The US’ David Cortez would remain on Prometheus, and act as CAPCOM for the lander free flight, simulating the light delay from Earth.</span></p>

On the 3rd day of flight, <i>Intrepid</i> would come to port at the bow of <i>Prometheus</i>, and the crew would move into their home away from home. The activation procedure had been largely the same as Olympus 1, with the crew settling into a comfortable routine in the spacious habitable volume of the ship. The first major event would be, after <i>Intrepid’s</i> departure, the maneuver into an elliptical orbit to simulate the arrival burn, which would take place on the night side of Mars during the mission proper. This burn was executed without issue, and the crew took their time to enjoy the coast up to apogee, watching the Earth grow smaller in their windows for several days. Soon, the planet would start to grow larger, and the crew would strap into their couches, and prepare for the arrival burn. This burn, crucial for their successful arrival at Mars, would push the engines to their absolute heating limits, and test the thermal management systems of the MTV in real time once again. The tick of the geiger counter would begin to comfort this crew as it had with Olympus 1, as the vehicle slowed from its high speed trajectory. Vibration in the crew cabin was minimal, and the crew soon could float free and begin to look for the Base Station in low orbit once again. After nearly 6 hours, the station would become visible. Nearly identical to the MTV that carried them, the vehicle stood ready to receive the crew as they approached, the ships communicating autonomously and assisting the crew. The distance between the two mammoth structures decreased, and the vehicles would finally be face to face, their docking adapters mere inches away. With a gentle pulse of the RCS, the great ships docked, sending a resounding thud throughout the vessels. Opening the hatches, the crew found themselves inside a huge structure, not dissimilar to their own. The doubled volume was welcomed - the whole facility was so large that earpieces would be required by the crew to ensure communication when the ships were docked. After about 10 days of flight, the next phase of the mission could begin, and <i>Monitor</i> was commanded by Mission Control Houston to approach the complex.</span></p>

<i>Monitor</i> slipped out of the shadows of orbital night, and was soon glinting in the sunlight as the Basecamp-MTV complex flew over northern Europe. The lander was large, as to be expected of a vehicle designed to land on another world, and maneuvered slowly as it approached. Her sheer size was a direct consequence of the fuels required to get her onto the planet in one piece, and her 7m diameter offered the potential for wet workshop conversion into a hab. As the forward port on both <i>Prometheus</i> and the Base Station were occupied, the lander would dock to the station’s radial port, where the Earth Return Lifeboat sat on the MTV. The approach was long, and eerily silent as the crew used laser rangefinders to check the speed and distance or the lander as it closed in on its target. Over the course of six hours, the two great ships would meet, and <i>Monitor</i> would soon flip itself to face the Earth, positioning it above the complex and lining up for docking. The lander approached to within 20 meters of the Base Station’s radial port, and paused, hanging above the gargantuan spacecraft. It was at this time that Sharon Kensworth would take the stick at a computer console, a virtual replica of the flight deck of the lander, and guide the spacecraft in for its final docking. The spacecraft, at first, was a little reluctant to respond to her commands, and a reset of its ultra high frequency antenna enabled communications to resume. Soon, Kensworth was able to pulse the reaction control system to push the spacecraft forward, towards the waiting APAS port. After a soft thump, the station and lander entered free drift, to neutralize any forces that lingered. Soon, the crew began to work on preparing the hatch, and soon, it would swing open. The vehicle was pristine, and after the crew moved 8 days worth of supplies into the habitation section, work could begin on running tests to prepare the crew for the next phase.<br>
<br>
At this point in the mission, the crew of Olympus 2 would split into the Red and Blue teams - Red corresponding to the landing crew, and blue corresponding to the orbital crew. Fisher, Kensworth, Okamura and Koniksen would enter the lander and close the hatch, preparing to conduct the first crewed flight of the MSAV. Much like Apollo 9 in the years before, this test would serve to validate the design choices of the lander, and familiarize crew with operations. The first step would be to undock from the complex and practice the maneuvers that would be required before a Mars-bound crew could commit to their de-orbit burn. Under Kensworth’s command, <i>Monitor</i> backed away from the complex and, like an orbiter visiting the space station, would conduct an end over end flip, letting the crew photograph the vehicle. <i>Monitor</i> responded well to commands, and the crew remarked how well the spacecraft handled, given its large size. The next phase of this free flight test would be a test of the descent stage, a short burn of the center engine, to verify the ignition system and change the orbit of the lander. It would also serve to dispose of the lower stage of the lander, and check the separation systems, as this lower orbit would lead to faster orbital decay. On the fourth day of the lander’s free flight, Fisher and Kensworth commanded the lander to fire its center LE-57M, pushing the crew into their seats and lowering their orbit. Over the next two orbits, the crew prepared for the final test of the flight program, free flight of the ascent stage. Unlike the Mars-bound landers,<i> Monitor</i> did not carry the solid propellant kick motors that would enable abort and kick the stage away from the rest of the structure, as it was deemed unsafe for operations in space. Instead,<i> Monitor’s</i> ascent stage would be pushed away from the descent stage by springs. With the crew strapped into their seats, the stages separated, and the upper stage LE-57M fired, pushing the crew back into their shared orbit with the MTV-Base Station complex. It would be another day before they could rendezvous, but soon, the hatches between the two spacecraft would be opened once again.<br>
<br>
Olympus 2 began to draw to a close, starting with the disposal of the ascent stage of <i>Monitor</i>. After being commanded to undock from the Base Station, the vehicle backed off, and would de-orbit itself over Point Nemo, ending the first successful mission of the MSAV. <i>Monitor</i>, an intrepid pioneer of human spaceflight, would be the only lander to meet their end over Earth, all that would come after would be cast into the cold embrace of the Red Planet. The crew turned their attention to preparing the Base Station for departure, and ultimately, its flight to Mars. As the crew spent their last few days on orbit, they would spend time storing small surprises for the upcoming Olympus 3 crew. Olympus 2 would be the last human crew to visit the station before the window to Mars opened in October. With the setup of the station complete, <i>Prometheus</i> would back away from the station, leaving their home away from home lingering in orbit. The MTV would lower its orbit slightly, and begin a quiet, week long cooldown period, awaiting the launch of <i>Intrepid</i> to retrieve them. The orbiter would rocket skyward on August 2nd, 1994, and encounter the MTV two days later. Opening the hatches, the crew were elated to see the orbiter crew, and were eager to head home to fresh air and a debriefing. For the crew of Olympus 2, it was the end, but for the mission planners of the Olympus program one of the greatest hurdles still remained: departure of the first infrastructure components.</span></p>

After Olympus 2’s return to Earth, OV-201 <i>Adventure</i> and OV-203 <i>Endurance</i> lofted two tankers to LEO, rendezvousing with the Mars Base Station and topping up propellant that had been depleted in the maneuvers conducted during the mission. The tankers would do their job diligently, and depart, falling into the atmosphere over the Pacific as Summer turned to Fall. On October 12th, the Valkyrie engines of the Mars Base Station lit, for real. To no one’s ears, the geiger counter onboard provided some comfort, a constant ticking as the engines powered her further and further beyond the pull of Earth’s gravity. To those observing on the ground, the reddish streak of her plume could be seen in the night sky, growing ever fainter as she traveled into the inky blackness. After what felt like an eternity to the engineers on the ground, the engines shut down, and the MBS assumed its cruise attitude.</span></p>

The great spacecraft, after 3 years loitering in Low Earth Orbit, was now on a trajectory out of the Earth-Moon system, and on to the Red Planet. The trajectory of the spacecraft had been so precise, that a second midcourse correction burn was omitted from the flight plan, a testament to those who built her. This profound creation of humankind was set for its encounter with destiny, the next great horizon. At the Cape, a Boeing Helios 5.4 vehicle rocketed skywards on October 28th, carrying with it the first Logistics Lander, <i>Marie Curie</i>. This vehicle was also unique as it carried with it the first, new 7m upper stage for Helios: Phaeton, which was planned for eventual use onboard the Jupiter-OPAV system. The first stage jettisoned its boosters, and ejected its recoverable engine pod, with the Phaeton second stage carrying it to a nominal parking orbit. About 20 minutes after arrival in orbit, the twin RL60 engines of the second stage lit again, sending the stage and the payload out of Earth’s sphere of influence. Soon the cruise stage of <i>Marie Curie</i> would deploy its solar panels, taking the first steps of the trek to Mars in tandem with the Base Station.</span></p>
