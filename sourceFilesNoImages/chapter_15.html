  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">F</span><span class="calibre6">or the launch market, it had been a strange time. In the wake of <i>Valiant’s</i> unfortunate demise, the Air Force had been stretched to find enough Titans and Delta 6000s to support their operations, facing competition from NASA’s Olympus program and other commercial interests. Atlas-Centaur, in the face of its age and ultimate cost, would be retired from service, with their pads sitting abandoned at both the Cape and Vandenberg. Immediately after <i>Valiant’s</i> accident, several companies had submitted proposals for vehicles that they believed could leverage the capability of the fallen orbiter, while still retaining technologies developed for the Shuttle program as a whole. Ultimately, the Delta 8000, a derivative of the Extended Long Tank Thor with a new, cryogenic second stage, and the Boeing EELV,  ultimately named Helios, would be selected. What made this selection the most appealing was the second stage, a common element between the two vehicles with a new, uprated RL10B-2 with an expanding nozzle. Work leveraged on cryogenic second stages led this particular second stage to take up the mantle of Centaur, and the Centaur Cryogenic Stage would see its debut on the first flight of Helios. Helios, of both vehicles selected, leveraged more technology from the shuttle; it used 2 Space Shuttle Main Engines on a reusable engine pod that would be recovered via parachute by either an aircraft or boat. To augment the liquid hydrogen first stage, either 2 or 4 CASTOR 120 motors could be mounted to the thrust structure enabling modularity for a variety of commercial and defense payloads.</span></p>

The first rollout took place in March of 1992 to LC-37B, which had recently completed a dramatic retrofit to bring it up to operational status. Compared to Deltas and Titans, the vehicle was best described as stubby. The vehicle was wide to support the dual engine mounts, and did not require the vertical stretch seen in skinnier vehicles. The fairing actually reused tooling seen on Titan to simplify its design, which to some engineers, looked like a tube of lipstick. Payload was the big selling point for this vehicle, with two ultra-efficient hydrolox stages, the vehicle could loft heavy payloads and place them in precise orbits thanks to the CCS’ extended loiter time. In a nod to the commercial sector, Boeing had also opted for a DSPF, the Dual Stack Payload Fairing, which resembled a Nesting Doll. In order to optimize for geostationary customers, the ability to launch two satellites at once was immediately agreed upon. For the first launch of Helios, two GPS satellites would be launched utilizing the longer fairing, as well as 4 CASTOR motors and the DSPF, colloquially known as the 5.4 configuration. This particular flight would also demonstrate the reusability aspect of the vehicle, with a Chinook being positioned on the <i>USS Blue Ridge</i> to recover the engine section downrange. This was a temporary and expensive solution, as Boeing was finalizing the deal to purchase a ship to convert for their own recovery needs. The vehicle lifted off after a range safety delay, and demonstrated the performance of the new RL10B-2, as well as proving the reliability of the legacy SSME and CASTOR motors. The engine pod, coasting towards the Atlantic on its parafoil, was recovered by the Chinook, and successfully landed on the deck of the recovery ship. For Boeing, and the rest of the commercial launch market, this set a new precedent: reusing components of vehicles could be common outside of the Shuttle and Jupiter OPAV fleet, and should be incorporated into economic models for the foreseeable future.<br>
  <br>
Further down the Cape, a Jupiter-OPAV stack rolled to the pad, carrying with it a new payload unique to the Olympus program: a tanker. Tanker No. 1 sat on top of the SDLV stack, but to the untrained eye, it didn’t appear to differ from the rest of the vehicle. It appeared to be an extension of the external tank, with a stubby fairing on top of the whole stack covering its docking systems. The SOFI that covered the tanker was identical to that used in the manufacturing of both Shuttle and Jupiter tanks, and for good reason. Similarities in construction allowed the vehicles to be manufactured fairly quickly, but instead of the liquid hydrogen used by the orbiter fleet and the OPAV, it would contain a slush hydrogen solution used for the MTV’s powerful nuclear engines, and the transfer element of Mars Base Station. While work had been done in space to ensure that boil off would be mitigated during the multi year round trip to Mars, work on the ground to support an ever deeper freeze had also been completed to support a new fuel type. The campaign with OV-202 Perseverance would be one of the longest fit check campaigns carried out for an OPAV-fleet vehicle since their debut in 1989. Various swing arms had to be checked, and the internal systems of the tanker had to be powered up and checked, as the tanker had to autonomously guide itself to the target MTV, and perform a careful docking maneuver. 3 months after the fit check campaign began, the actual launch campaign could begin. Rolling back from the VAB to LC-39B, the vehicle and its ground crew felt ready for this next phase, the start of a dedicated refueling infrastructure in orbit. The vehicle was fueled, and after a sticky valve prevented launch on the first attempt, the stack lifted off into a 51.6º orbit. While the tanker would not be docking with the completed MTV stack on this flight, it would conduct proximity operations with the Odyssey-MTV complex, with the crew onboard using long range cameras to image and perform an orbital checkout post ascent. The tanker’s demo mission had two objectives: demonstrate the thermal control systems required for maintaining the vital slush consistency of the fuel, and the precise control required for docking with a delicate structure like the MTV. The crew onboard Odyssey was impressed with the condition of the vehicle post-ascent, and stationkeeping between the two objects showed the benefits of the delicate flight control software that had been installed onboard. In a pitch maneuver, the crew was able to image the docking mechanism and lighting array on the front of the tank, which would enable autonomous docking and fueling operations even in orbital night. The vehicle demonstrated stability of fuel throughout its mission, clearing the way for fueling operations to begin on the MTV. After a week in orbit, the tanker fired its reaction control system for de-orbit, streaking into the atmosphere under the watchful eye of both Odyssey and Zarya. The tanker met its end in Point Nemo, but the next phase of testing with the tankers could begin with the Mars Base Station.<br>
<br>
For a long time, the greatest test would come when the MTV would depart its orbital gantry and begin free flight tests, carried out autonomously at first. Controllers in Moscow and Houston, working in conjunction with their international partners, would supervise the next very delicate phase; undocking of the MTV from its place of birth, finally free to begin a lifetime of exploration and discovery. All of the delicate manipulator arms were retracted away from the vehicle, and the crew, in an abundance of caution, retreated to their Liberté CRV, and the undocking procedure could begin. Soon, the hooks on the station side APAS adapter would slide out of the MTV’s, and the vehicle would be suspended in the microgravity of Low Earth Orbit all on its own. The vehicle moved so slowly, it almost seemed to be staying still.. Small clusters of station keeping thrusters, derivatives of the RCS-VT (R-1E) found on the Space Shuttle Orbiter fleet, were pulsed across the vehicle. Like huffs of some great monster’s breath, the jets would get the vehicle moving at less than one meter per second, moving delicately in the orbital ballet of microgravity. The departure from the keep out ellipsoid took roughly an hour and a half, and the watchful eye of the crew onboard Odyssey kept a look out from every window they could. As <i>Minerva</i> moved further away, the heat dissipation system deployed, cooling both the tanks and the nuclear engines, essential for long duration burns. To those onboard Odyssey, the MTV had come to life, transforming into not simply a product of construction, but a dedicated spaceship, destined to take humanity to another world. For the engineers on the ground, and the crew of the upcoming Olympus 1, the test that they had been waiting for had finally come to pass. She could fly on her own, and all of the math and hard work that went into her inception had paid off. Over the next several days, Minerva increased her orbit with her OMS engines, sitting at a final position of around 20 km behind Odyssey in the orbital train, with the Mars Base Station and <i>Zarya</i> behind her.</span></p>

In August of 1992, Space Shuttle <i>Discovery</i> was rolled out to the pad with the first component of MTV-02 in its cargo bay, an identical Utility Node to the one delivered for the first MTV, <i>Minerva</i>. The orbiter lifted off from LC-39A on August 16, 1992, early in the sleepy summer morning. The launch would be famous, as the rising sun intersected with the column of smoke left behind by the solid rocket motors, leading to one of the most stunning photos of the Shuttle system's history. <i>Discovery</i>, once again, performed flawlessly, and slipped comfortably into her 51.6º orbit.  After a two day chase, the crew of the shuttle rendezvoused with the crowded complex, under the watchful eyes of the Odyssey crew, with <i>Zarya</i> loitering stoically ahead. Issues with guidance sensors on the PMA, and the retroreflectors on shuttle prevented the initial docking attempt, so the shuttle backed off to wait for a recalibration of the approach sensors. This kind of hassle was only becoming more common, and many within the Space Station office would recommend a potential upgrade path for the docking systems. <i>Discovery</i> would troubleshoot with the station for 2 and a half hours,  before finally docking with the station over the Atlantic ocean. The node was handed off to the station’s robotic manipulation systems, and firmly bolted to the upper PMA, ready to start the process of construction once again. By the end of the year, the first two tank elements of <i>Prometheus</i> would be delivered to Odyssey, and the assembly of a true interplanetary fleet had begun.</span></p>
