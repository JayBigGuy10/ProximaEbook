  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">I</span><span class="calibre6">n the wake of their exposé, the Air Force was forced to go public - they had indeed been constructing a facility for observation and repair of reconnaissance satellites, and had been servicing this newborn station with early test flights of their own fully reusable crew vehicle - the Boeing built Pegasus Two Stage Reusable Orbiter. The vehicle, having been in the works throughout the early 80s, had been rushed through development after the first issue in internal safety culture had cropped up, and been further expedited after OF-19. Pegasus had seen limited crew use so far, staged out of Groom Lake in Nevada, and operated with high degrees of secrecy. Several suborbital flights had been undertaken and a full orbital flight only twice with the first operational vehicle, <i>Excalibur</i>. The public outcry was immense: in the face of Olympus, a relic of a more militant age was seen as a disgrace, and in the lessons learned from <i>Valiant</i>, why would the military want to conquer the cosmos once again? The Air Force, in their hubris, had not been willing to relinquish the capability of a vehicle like the shuttle, even if it meant going behind the backs of the public. A Congressional hearing demanded the immediate declassification of the program, and an indefinite stand down and reorganization of the program as a whole into a more civilian facing, and a politically savory one at that. In the hearing, standard operations of the Pegasus program were detailed: the first stage booster, and Pegasus orbital vehicle, would be fueled at Groom Lake, and take off due west over the Pacific Ocean. There, once sufficiently far away from land, would conduct their ascent. The two vehicles would enter a rocket powered climb and separate, with the booster coasting back down to a powered landing at Groom Lake, and the orbital vehicle continuing to its destination, where it would eventually service KH-11 and Misty satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office. Several lawmakers were quick to point out the apparent lack of crewed military space endeavors elsewhere in the world, and were eager to phase the use of Pegasus into the commercial sector, and encourage development of the vehicle into something for the civilian market. The ODIN baseblock, a commercial satellite bus converted into the core of the servicing structure, would be quietly deorbited in the early spring, a shameful end for the crewed Air Force program. It was, at this time, when the Boeing Corporation would begin to look at options for their fleet of 2 orbiters: <i>Excalibur</i> and <i>Trident</i> - could there be a future where such vehicles even mattered? To those within NASA, and the civilian space sector, a glimmer of hope existed where one had not before. Could this vehicle, in its up in the air state, be converted to fit someone’s needs?<br>
<br>
Across the civilian space program, the attitude was best described as chomping at the bit. Olympus continued to proceed at a record pace, and construction on MTV-2 <i>Prometheus</i> was nearing completion after 5 months of construction. Shuttle missions had picked up in regularity, visiting not only Odyssey for regular rotations of crew and Cargo, but to <i>Minerva</i> as well as the Mars Base Station. With the five ships in the orbiter fleet, they were nearing the turnaround times estimated during the initial planning of the Space Transportation System as a whole, much to the delight of those who carried the program through Congress. <i>Intrepid</i>, during this time, had been taken out of service in regular rotations for a unique modification, the addition of a pallet to carry the crew. While the shuttle was capable of carrying the 8 crew members required for an Olympus mission, it became clear that a support crew of up to 4 would be required to assist them into the MTV, prep the hatches, and subsequently land the vehicle back on Earth. This additional crew space could also be sealed in the event that planetary contamination became a concern, something that mission planners were still considering. The pallet would consist of three parts; the docking tunnel, the crew habitation and supplies section, with external payload racks and the Extended Duration Orbiter pallet. This would begin <i>Intrepid’s</i> career as the Martian Support Orbiter, and would run all future missions to and from the MTVs.</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
<i>Minerva</i> and the Mars Base Station at the start of 1993, had finished full outfitting in preparations for the first active flight tests of the program. This mission would be roughly four months in duration, and would see the vehicle maneuver through a variety of orbits using the Valkyrie nuclear engines. It would also simulate supplying the MTV with the twin MLPMs required for each mission, and would see the debut of the Earth Return Lifeboat, built by German consortium Messerschmitt Bolkow Blohm. The lifeboat would be attached to the radial APAS port during operational missions and could maneuver around the MTV using onboard propulsion. The next step for <i>Minerva’s</i> operation would be a full fueling test, utilizing the quick turnaround of Jupiter-OPAV to practice fueling the vehicle for Martian operations. The cadence of flight saw all four high bays activated in the VAB, with stacking of vehicles taking place over the course of four weeks. As soon as the crawler was returned to the VAB, stacking work would begin again, with the whole operation taking roughly two months to fully fuel the MTV and its drop tanks. With the departure of <i>Endeavour</i> in May, 1993, and the installation of the last mission specific MLPM, <i>Minerva</i> was finally configured for the first test flight of the mission, Olympus 1. Earth Return Lifeboat-1 had been launched on a Helios 5.4 in April, and remained attached to the Utility Node’s top port. The fuel was delivered on time by the sequence of resupply tankers, and soon, <i>Intrepid</i> would be tasked with delivering the crew of the first Olympus mission. The crew of 8 would represent the first humans to pilot an interplanetary spacecraft, a truly monumental feat. <i>Intrepid</i> launched early in the morning of July 3, 1993, chasing the MTV as it crossed the Eastern Seaboard. The MTV crew, commanded by NASA veteran Mark Teller, soon caught sight of their vehicle as <i>Intrepid</i> inched ever closer. The crew, a diverse representation of the countries involved in the program, had been some of the first astronauts brought into the Mars Cadre. Anna M. Douglass, the MTV pilot, had been a rookie, but had spent hours both in commercial and military aviation, flying 747s for United Airlines as well as C-5 Galaxies in the Air Force. Her career had been notable in that she had been the first Black woman to command a C-5 for the Air Force. The flight surgeon, Dr. Yevgeniy Volkov, was a medical doctor who had been stationed in the former Soviet Union’s Antarctic bases, and was trained in frontier medicine. He had also been the first former Soviet cosmonaut to fly to Odyssey, a feat remembered by many as a sign that perhaps the Cold War could end. Europe’s first Olympus astronaut, Lara Nespoli of Italy, was a solar physicist who had spent her undergraduate years reviewing data from Skylab’s solar telescope, and had trained in deep space stellar navigation. Thomas Bromley, Australia’s first Olympus astronaut, had flown two training missions to the MTV already when it was under construction. Fred Williams had been a former <i>Valiant</i> flier, retiring from the Air Force in the wake of his former ship’s untimely demise. Shiro Maekawa of NASDA and Maisie Mitchel of NASA would serve as mission specialists 4 and 5, both rookies, but possessing three advanced science degrees between them. Along with the 3 additional crew members who would command <i>Intrepid</i> on her journey home, the orbiter inched ever closer to the gargantuan spacecraft, hanging so delicately in orbit around Earth. </span></p>

<i>Minerva</i>, like a great beast awakening from a long slumber, activated her systems autonomously as the Shuttle came within the Keep Out Sphere, extending docking targets and cycling the life support so that the air would not be stale when the crew came onboard. As with all shuttle dockings, Intrepid moved slowly and carefully towards the forward port, and soon, two vehicles would become one. The immediate task for the crew would be to open the hatches and become acquainted with their home away from home for the next four months. The crew would first open the hatches to the two MPLMs on either side of the Utility Node, and begin to distribute the cargo that had been brought up by <i>Endeavour’s</i> crew. In the variety of cargo bags, they found notes from their past crew mates, wishing them luck on this most noble test flight. The crew also checked out their lifeboat, ERL-01, and ensured that its systems were functional and ready in the event of an emergency. After 3 days of docked operations, <i>Intrepid</i> would depart and back away, imaging the vehicle as it hung carefully over the Pacific ocean. The 8 crew members would, in turn, image <i>Intrepid</i> as she backed away, performing the pitch maneuver so common of shuttle flights to allow for inspection of the Thermal Protection System. Like the cupola on Odyssey, <i>Minerva’s</i> cupola would become a popular destination for the crew members. As the shuttle faded into a streak of light, bound for the Shuttle Landing Facility, the crew moved to prepare the ship for the next phase of their journey.<br>
Flight day 10 would be one of the most eventful, a test of the crew and ship, as they’d fire the Valkyrie engines for the first time with a full complement of astronauts. The process would be no different from burns in the history of the space program, strapping in to the designated couches in the “flight control” area of <i>Minerva</i>. Onboard, the atmosphere was tense. Never before had nuclear engines been fired with a crew onboard - even though every test on the ground, of Way-Seeker, had proven that these vehicles were safe, the anxiety was palpable. The igniter panel, located centrally on the flight control console, was labeled in bright red and yellow, and inspired a certain degree of dread. Upon confirmation from Mission Control in Houston that they were clear to proceed, both Teller and Douglass were required to confirm and validate their “go” status for the ignition - turning keys similar to that of a nuclear missile launch. Once confirmed, the reactors onboard were powered on, and the engines lit; pushing the astronauts into their couches. Items that had been stored improperly drifted towards the back of the spacecraft, and the only sound audible to the crew was the tick of their geiger counter, monitoring radiation levels inside the spacecraft. In the heads of the crew, anxiety transitioned to excitement, as the trajectory computer showed their course changing - they were to be the highest flying astronauts since the Apollo Era. The flight computer would continue to tick up until the nuclear engines would be commanded to shut down, with the final apoapsis sitting at a comfortable 42,857 miles above the Earth’s surface. A shorter burn at apoapsis would raise the craft outside of the Van Allen radiation belt, and the crew could begin their operations - a test of systems, experiments, life support and more. In the coast that followed, <i>Minerva</i> was well tempered, a testament to all of those who built her. The veteran astronauts reported that she was far quieter than Odyssey or <i>Zarya</i>, and certainly much roomier. The inflatable habitat was something of a luxury for those who had spent their first flights onboard the stations or Shuttle. Soon, the vehicle would fire its engines again, and settle into a comfortable orbit at 42,857 x 41,998 miles above the Earth’s surface. Olympus 1’s main goal was to test the crew systems, as well as iron out any bugs that may develop, and the comfortable routine of high orbit operations began to settle in.</span></p>

The mission, in its first month, was fairly uneventful. Tests of the orbital maneuvering engines, derived from the Shuttle OMS system, also worked well, and demonstrated fine control of the vehicle as they circled the planet. The next major test would be EVA drills, simulating repair of the vehicle in flight. For Lara Nespoli and Fred Williams, this would mean stepping out of their spacecraft into the void of space. Flight day 43 would see the two close the hatch to the Utility Node, and translate outside onto the tank structure of the MTV. With only <i>Minerva</i> below them, the Earth hung in front of them, further from any astronaut in a long time. The images beamed to Mission Control were breathtaking, the beauty and majesty of Earth suspended in an inky void. Nespoli and Williams, wearing their ARES suits, would make the trip to the solar array and inspect the master rotary joint, collect samples from an externally mounted experiment installed years ago, and return - all the while documenting their experience through their handheld and helmet cams. Inside, the crew positioned Minerva’s robotic arm to get a clear shot of the spacewalkers as they clambered around the outside of the vehicle, and soon, the crew would make their way back towards the airlock, and could doff their spacesuits. Tired, but overjoyed, the crew celebrated their success, and made contact with their colleagues on Odyssey and the ground. The third month of the voyage was largely consumed with preparation for the return to LEO, and once again testing the long loiter time restart of the nuclear engines. Strapped into their couches once again, Teller and Douglass commanded <i>Minerva</i> to ignite her engines and begin the journey home. For a brief moment, in the minds of the crew, the incidents of nuclear engine testing in the 60s crossed through their mind, but <i>Minerva</i> would not fail them. Ignition of the nuclear engines would send a resounding shock through the spacecraft as a whole, as their bodies were pressed into their acceleration couches. The burn was successful, and the crew could relax for a moment as they began the long fall. With every passing hour, Earth would grow in their windows, and what had been fuzzy from a distance soon became clear. Soon would come the second burn of the return phase of the mission, the capture maneuver. The crew would climb into their couches once more and command the MTV to point retrograde. As the spacecraft pivoted, the Earth came into view, racing below their feet as the keys were turned, and the force of the engines burning pushed the crew against their seats. As the vehicle had used a decent amount of propellant to transfer to high orbit, vibrations were more apparent, and as before, the geiger counter continued to tick. It became, to the crew, something of a comforting presence, as the great machine around them did her job to bring the crew home. Soon, they’d settle into a comfortable, low Earth orbit while they waited for the nuclear engines to enter their safe state. The city lights of the planet below would once again become clear, and the crew would host several press conferences in the coming weeks, documenting their record setting experience.<br>
<br>
<i>Minerva</i>, under the power of her OMS engines, would coast into the same orbit as the Base Station, Odyssey with the nascent <i>Prometheus</i>, and <i>Zarya</i>, finally ready for her crew to come home. <i>Intrepid</i> would lift off to retrieve the crew, rendezvousing with <i>Minerva</i> after 3 days in flight. The approach, as all shuttle approaches were, was slow and steady. The crew of the orbiter would soon be embracing the record setting crew of <i>Minerva</i>, and the process to power down the great machine that had carried them to great heights could begin. After final inspection by Commander Teller, the hatch swung closed, and the crew of Olympus 1 could begin the voyage home. Compared to the MTV, <i>Intrepid</i> felt small to the crew, and Volkov had expressed his eagerness to feel the sticky Florida heat once more. The orbiter completed its deorbit burn, and the crew strapped themselves into their seats for landing. The Florida heat would come soon enough, as <i>Intrepid</i> touched down in twilight, rolling to a stop, bringing its mission, and Olympus 1 to a close on November 7th, 1993. For the moment, there was calm, as the support vehicles raced to the orbiter to help the spacefarers out of their noble ship. But for those planning the missions? This was only the beginning. The beginning of so much to come. </span></p>
