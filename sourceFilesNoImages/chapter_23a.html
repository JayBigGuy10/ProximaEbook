  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi everyone, We've got some really amazing shots from <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> this week that I've been sitting on, really eager to showcase them for you all today and highlight how busy space has become. If my planning serves me correctly, this should be the maximum number of Olympus missions being active at once, but of course that could change in the future depending on how things go. Anyway, let's take a look!</span></p>

  <i>Olympus 4 prepares for Martian Orbit Insertion, having completed the trek between the planets. All that is left is to align her in the correct attitude, and fire up the Valkyrie engines for the multi-minute maneuver.

  <i>Her drop tanks cleanly separating, Prometheus pushes on towards capture. The Valkyrie's engineering speaks volumes, showcasing their robust design and long mission life. The spent drop tanks would coast back into a heliocentric orbit.

  <i>The final seconds of the burn are always the most crucial, and Prometheus' crew is already looking at their shutdown procedures. Soon, the vehicle would coast through Martian orbit, and link up with the Base Station complex.</i>

  <i>Back at Earth, Minerva enters the final hours of her interplanetary journey, coasting towards her capture burn to bring her crew home. It has been a long voyage, and the sight of the Earth filling the windows of the ship brings great relief to the crew, but they are not out of the woods yet.â€‹

  <i>Slipping into orbital night, the longest burn of the mission can take place, capturing the crew into a stable orbit around the Earth for retrieval by Space Shuttle Intrepid.

  <i>At long last, the burn is over, and the first human crew on Mars can watch the Earth pass below them, just 250 miles away. Soon, Intrepid would rendezvous with the crew and retrieve them, bringing to a close the greatest Odyssey in human history.</i>

  <i>Receiving the go from Mission Control, Hera lights her Valkyrie engines and pushes onwards to Venus, the first human crew to do so. Her 150 day transfer and smaller crew complement would enable maximum use of the MTV as a science platform.</i>

  <i>Hera ditches her first set of Drop Tanks in an eccentric Earth orbit, almost free of the gravity of the planet. These tanks would later be recovered and used on a future MTV, enabling potential full systems reuse in future generations of Transfer Vehicles.â€‹

  <i>Finally free of the planet, Hera proceeds to Venus, ready to make history with Humanity's expansion into the solar system.</i>

It's been an exciting time, and we've finally reached the year 2000! We're really making great strides into the unknown, and our human crews are feasting their eyes on sights as yet unseen. I'm really always eternally grateful to have the support of both <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PZerg5" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Zarbon</a> in these amazing images and mission patches, and we're gonna get some amazing art from some familiar and new faces next week! I absolutely cannot wait to show you, so let's get started and explore! ðŸ˜Ž</span></p>
