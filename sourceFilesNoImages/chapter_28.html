  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">O</span><span class="calibre6">n the first of July 2004, billions of miles away from Earth, the Cassini spacecraft retracted the cover to its propulsion system, oriented itself, and prepared for orbital insertion around the ringed giant, Saturn. The spacecraft had spent 7 years in the icy grip of deep space, and now, the great and magnificent world loomed large before the digital eyes of the spacecraft. For the mission team, cruise had been relatively uneventful, waking the dormant spacecraft occasionally to poke and prod at its systems, and make sure that the ship remained functional. Now, for the first time since launch, the great spacecraft would be put through its paces, and work to complete the arrival burn. Its main engine, a derivative of the venerable R-4D thruster, would soon spring to life to begin the nearly 100 minute burn. As a consequence, the spacecraft could not communicate with Earth via the high gain antenna, instead only transmitting a low gain carrier tone throughout the maneuver. Factoring in the light delay, it was a rather tense moment for the mission team. In JPL, the peanuts were out in full force, and the flight team looked anxiously at the signal from the deep space network, desperate to see if this great spacecraft had made the voyage in one piece. The silence cut deep, and as the probe swung behind the planet, it would work to capture images of the planet as the burn was conducted. The probe soldiered on, and soon, the engines onboard would shut down, and the probe would fine tune its attitude. Eventually, after a full systems check, it would point its high gain antenna at a distant speck in the depths of space, and would transmit its health data, confirming to those on the ground that humanity had made orbit around another world, Saturn. The immediate science and commissioning phase would put Cassini to the test, flexing all of the science instruments onboard, and preparing for the first year at the planet. The pictures Cassini would take during the first year would fundamentally change the way humankind viewed the ringed giant, no longer this great leviathan but a figure suspended in the delicate harmonies of gravity, so fragile seeming. The true magnum opus for Cassini’s first year would come in the form of Titan, and the glinting methane seas peeking through the foggy atmosphere. The image of a glinting, methane ocean on the surface of Titan would shock the world, and the anticipation towards the release of the Huygens lander would only grow. Soon, the time for the deployment of the intrepid landing probe would come, as Cassini swung by the massive moon. Huygens was cast off into the abyss, calling back into the void to the ship that carried it here. Cassini would turn and point its camera at the little space probe as it fell towards this alien world, unsure of what exactly it would find on the surface. The probe would slam into the atmosphere, the turbulent gasses ionizing around the spacecraft and preventing the little spacecraft from transmitting. It would be a painful few minutes for those on the ground, but soon, the camera eyes of Huygens would open to reveal an alien world, so different from the one that had created it. It saw the flowing of rivers into oceans, and waves lapping at a gentle shore. The probe would set down on a gently sloping seashore, and an onboard microphone would record the scraping of the hull against the ice and rock, the first sounds from the outer planets. It was a tremendous triumph, and science teams around the world celebrated as this brave little probe performed its precious hours of science. </span></p>

On Mars, the changing of hands was nearly upon the crew, and the astronauts of Olympus 7 had wrapped up their work, and left behind their great base on the planet’s surface. Their departure from the Red Planet had gone smoothly, and the transit period back to Earth was a welcome rest from their activities on the planet. Despite the hiccups earlier in the mission, the actual surface period had exceeded many of their expectations, and proved to be far more comfortable than the short stay sorties of the previous missions. Their nearly 400 sols on the surface had amassed an impressive sample size, and the crew worked tirelessly to perform scientific analysis on the materials they had collected. A highlight of the mission had been the discovery of trace gasses trapped within some of the rocks, and seeping out of the ground, indicating to the crew that there was a potential process that governed this kind of behavior. It was not out of the question that geological processes could be contributing to the release of methane and other volatiles, but it was also not entirely out of the question that organic processes could lead to the same result. Nevertheless, the crew worked tirelessly in the first floor of their habitat, carefully dissecting the samples they collected. Some of the experiments they had conducted focused entirely on spaceflight research, aiming to assist later crews in their stays upon the planet’s surface. Such experiments included exercise regimes, dietary analysis and other experimental human health tests. Another unique test that was conducted was the use of hydroponics to grow crops onboard, aiming to meet two objectives: crew psychological comfort and consumption of vitamins and minerals from fresh fruits and vegetables. During their stay, they grew 3 separate crops of lettuce, 2 of spinach, and attempted a batch of potatoes before ultimately not finding them to be viable hydroponically. These activities also were remarkable in how much the crew looked forward to them, eager to spend their time working on things that reminded them of home. Dust storm season had been, luckily, much more manageable than they expected, and the crews would perform limited EVAs to install weather monitoring stations around their basecamp.  As the summer turned to fall on Earth, the crew of Olympus 7 would make their return to their home planet, eager to leave that chapter of their lives closed, but deeply longing for the adventure at their core. Their return journey was uneventful, and gave them time to rest and recuperate. Upon arrival at Earth, they were plucked from the heavens by the crew of <i>Intrepid</i>, more than eager for their debrief. When comparing post flight interviews between the short and long stay crews, the long stay crew seemed to have a much more cohesive narrative of their experience, as they had worked together to accomplish goals and negated issues of splitting the crew up. All in all, and despite the complications of the early mission, proved that the long stay was the way forward. Their return was heralded as a huge success for the program, showcasing the benefits of the conversion design for the lander. The crew would remain incredibly close even after their mission had drawn to a close, with Dr. Bianchi and Mission Specialist Takahashi getting married in the spring of 2010.</span></p>

On pad 39A and 39B, two Jupiter-OPAVs sat stacked with their Phaeton upper stages, and even more precious cargo. The cargo in question was the pre staging equipment for the upcoming Olympus 9 mission, destined to leave for the Red Planet in a little over 2 years. They would soon lift off from the twin pads a day apart, casting them on a trajectory that would take them on a lengthy journey to Gusev Crater, a rich bio-geological site which hopefully held more clues to the origins of the planet. Their OPAV pods, <i>Adventure</i> and <i>Tenacity</i>, would be recovered in the desert at White Sands, and the crews would work to quickly load them onto their carrier aircraft to ready them for their next flight. The accident of 2001 still sat in their minds, but the comprehensive review carried out of the Jupiter-OPAV system ensured that something like this would never happen again. The problem observed during Olympus 7’s pre-staging had been identified after a lengthy investigation, revealing a pyrotechnic bolt that had been manufactured to the wrong standard. Luckily for the crew of Olympus 8, the deployment of their Augmentation Landers had gone to plan, setting them down in Jezero Crater, yet another geologically interesting site that hopefully held the clues to the planet’s past. Their landers waited patiently for the arrival of the crew, ready to make history as they prepared for their departure. The Olympus 8 crew, themselves, had spent the last year training extensively for their mission to the Red Planet, and further advancing their previous crew’s work on living off of the land. Part of the mission's main scientific objectives in the Jezero Crater region would be analysis of the exposed geological features, and a traverse up the outflow delta to look for dried aquifers. The unofficial science team motto for the mission was "Step by Step the the Source," highlighting the importance of meticulous analysis of the landscape. The crew of Olympus 8 would be commanded by the second non-US citizen to lead up a mission to the Red Planet, German born ESA astronaut Alexander Mensen. The MTV pilot for Olympus 8 would be NASA’s Blake Ripley-Jones, a former Naval pilot. Their flight surgeon would be NASA’s Dr. Craig Healy, a woodland paramedic and cardiologist who would go on to become the youngest NASA astronaut to fly to Mars at the age of 29. Konstantin Tereshkova, of Russia, would act as the scientific lead for the mission, and would deploy new and refreshed experiments to help aid in the ever present search for life. NASA’s Michael L. Jones would pilot the MTV to the surface, joined on his right by Spain’s Juan Del Rey. JAXA’s Hiroyuki Ikuta and ESA’s Claude Heltier would be the habitation specialists, performing the task of augmentation module checkout and docking. They were a fine crew, and would enable the further exploration of the planet. Their media tour pre-launch was one of the first uses of NASA on social media, enabling greater outreach for children and adults alike. In the days leading up to launch, they would spend time at the beach, isolated from the rest of the world with a layer of comfort, and soon head for the launch pad.</span></p>

<i>Intrepid</i> sat on pad 39A, ready to carry the crew of Olympus 8 to <i>Prometheus</i>, waiting patiently in orbit. Since her last flight, <i>Prometheus</i> had been refit with improved avionics, an improved solar shelter, and new racks for experiments, including microgravity gardening. This had been a feature the Olympus 7 crew had reviewed quite favorably. During their first countdown, wind constraints would force a recycle, causing the crew to wait on the ground until their lander, <i>Lynx</i>, had departed. There was some concern that the crew would not be able to make the window to leave, and have to wait a considerable length of time to be reassigned, but Intrepid and the weather would finally cooperate, sending the crew off on their voyage. The orbiter would leap from the pad and pitch over, beginning the 8 ½ minute ride to orbit, and subsequent day and a half chase to <i>Prometheus</i>. She sat, so elegantly suspended in orbit of the Earth, her solar panels glinting in the unfiltered sun. No matter who flew to her, who ferried crew, or who was about to embark on a great expedition, these great ships were always a sight to behold. Intrepid would dock at the forward port of the MTV, and would start the process of unloading cargo into the great volume of the craft, and begin to prepare the crew for departure. For the delivery crews, it was always a bittersweet moment - on one hand, the advancement of human science to push them to a new world, but at the same time, the farewells to the crew, and the farewells to Earth still hurt. Intrepid would back away, and the crew would hold handmade signs up to the windows of the orbiter for <i>Prometheus’</i> crew to see, documenting the final departure of humans they’d see until their return. Olympus 8 would cast off from Earth two days after <i>Intrepid’s</i> departure, pushing humans deeper and deeper into interplanetary space. The first months of their cruise were uneventful as they settled in, ready to explore a world slowly becoming familiar to humanity. Along with them was a passenger, a small multiple impactor probe to be deployed autonomously by the MTV while the crew performed their activities on the surface. With the lessons learned from <i>Hera</i> at Venus, the MTV could act as a venerable science platform all on its own, enabling the crews on Mars to collect science from multiple angles. After they began their sortie on the surface, and converted their lander into a long stay habitat, they would begin to conduct their scientific mission, aiming to answer questions about the Red Planet's past, and begin to ponder the future of humanity once again.</span></p>

In the jungle of French Guiana, something startled the hundreds of thousands of organisms that called this tranquil paradise home. A great rumbling, and a crack as an Ariane V roared into the twilight sky. Onboard, not one, but two passengers, designed to travel together to a mysterious world, a comet discovered long ago called 67P Churyumov/Gerasimenko. This world, discovered long ago, had been a notable long period comet, and proposed for study numerous times. The larger of the two spacecraft was Persephone, a deep space satellite equipped with the latest technology for maneuvers in space, an ion drive, designed to convert the power of the sun into usable energy. Persephone would act as the mothership and brains of the operation, while the smaller, more maneuverable Aeon probe would move to intercept the comet and explore it up close, ultimately returning a sample of this icy world to the mothership. It had been a bold idea when thought up years ago, and there were concerns that something of this scale would not be possible given ESA’s commitment to other programs, but the dream of exploration had pushed the mission through its political muck. Development of a system to collect the cometary material had pushed some of the engineers across ESA’s member states to their absolute limits, testing everything they thought they knew about spacecraft design. Ultimately, it came down to a bizarre solution: after nearly 10 years of travel together, the two spacecraft would separate as they arrived at the comet, with Aeon making the journey towards the nucleus. There, Aeon would secure itself to the surface of the comet, and act as a stationary workplace, operating as the comet drifted further and further away from the sun. Then as the comet once again approached the sun, its surface getting warmer, Aeon would wake from its quiescent mode, and prepare to collect the best sample it could find to be delivered to the waiting mothership. Persephone would be the ultimate catcher's mitt, picking up a small container of samples ejected out of a system onboard Aeon called the Near Earth Retrieval Facility, or NERF. Persephone would then use her solar electric system to depart from the comet, and head back to Earth where she would deploy her samples for collection, roughly in 2019. As the probe spread its wings, it would extend its robotic catch arm, equipped with a camera to take an image of itself and the Earth in the background, receding into the distance. It was the first image of many taken by the probe, and pointed towards a bright future for the exploration of comets. </span></p>
