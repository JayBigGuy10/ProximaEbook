  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all, I hope you all enjoyed the debut of our new launch system, Jupiter! Jupiter has been such a labor of love to design and develop, and I'm really happy that we are moving to kind of the penultimate stage of testing with the Olympus program as a whole. We really only have the certification of Liberté left before we can begin construction of the MTVs, and move towards the operational phase of the program. I wanted to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/lrrrrofop8" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Tracker</a> for these images, in lieu of <i>Valiant </i>he has really been on it in terms of coming up with new and exciting stuff to showcase for you all. I also wanted to highlight the rather unusual system from launch to landing, so there will be some repeat shots in today's image annex so I hope you don't mind too terribly. Anyway, enjoy!</span></p>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all, I've got a long post for you guys today! This week we're finishing up the last qualification flights to get started on the assembly of the MTV. We're really in the home stretch now before we can start final prep work for our Mars-shot. Our Crew Return Vehicle, much like it was in real life before it got cancelled, has faced lengthy delays but we are finally there. I can't wait for you all to meet all <i>six</i> CRVs we'll have on rotation. I wanna give a special huge thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a>, who has once again blown me away with turning thoughts into reality, with his work on so many amazing vehicles - and so many more to come. I really encourage you all to check out Jay's work on twitter as well! I also want to thank a new contributor, <a href="https://twitter.com/Daylight44492" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Daylight</a>, for their amazing amazing work on OPAV, a vehicle which seems to have really struck a chord with so many of you! Please give these two wonderful people all the love, they deserve it!<br>
<br>
Anyway, let's go!
