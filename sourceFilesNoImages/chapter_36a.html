  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Good morning everyone!, This week, we're looking both at Mars and Earth as we start to prepare for what's next for both our Space Stations, and access to the surface of the Red Planet. I'm very very excited for what we have planned, and as we get into the start of the end of Proxima, we can begin to wonder about the future and what that has in store for us. I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> as always for being a trooper and working with me on our designs, I cannot wait to showcase some stuff that'll be talked about in this chapter and beyond. The future is well and truly here, even in 2013!</span></p>
