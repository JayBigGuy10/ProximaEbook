  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">A</span><span class="calibre6">fter the learning curve of STS-11, and the resounding success of the program thus far, NASA officially put forward their call for additional astronauts, including those who did not have traditional degrees in science, or come from a test pilot background. To some, this seemed like a waste of time. <i>Non</i> scientists? What would be the point? Would anyone apply? But to those at NASA, they knew what they were doing. Looking at previous recruitment campaigns that the agency had run, NASA once again turned to television and the allure of science fiction. Citing their work with Nichelle Nichols in 1977, Leonard Nimoy, of Star Trek fame, would take to television and deliver a message for the agency that would ring true for generations of aspiring astronauts.<br/>

			“Do you have what it takes to be the next starship captain? Not here, on the Enterprise that I serve on, but on NASA’s Space Shuttle fleet. Astronaut candidates are needed to help propel us into the future, as we work to prepare for the next phase of human space exploration. Scientists, Educators, Doctors and more are all needed to make the push towards a 21st century in space. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is seeking those who would further their mission to boldly go, and explore strange new worlds!”

</blockquote>The campaign would be a massive success, with thousands of astronaut candidates pouring in from all over the country. NASA would find itself awash with applicants, many of whom came from diverse backgrounds and represented the new age of humans in space that NASA had hoped for. Out of all of the candidates, 37% were women, 45% were non-white, and 40% had pilot experience in a military setting. This new, diverse and incredibly talented selection of individuals would have to be whittled down to 21 by 1985, a seemingly impossible task, but one that NASA’s recruitment office was eager to tackle. Around the world, international agencies were readying their new recruits; 10 from the European Space Agency, 7 from the Japanese National Space Development Agency, and 4 from the Canadian Space Agency, who would all train in Houston with the NASA astronauts. NASA’s Educator Astronaut corps had also blossomed, welcoming teachers from across the country, and ranging from elementary school to college and graduate level. For NASA, it was a win, more than enough astronauts to train and work with to advance their goals. <br/>
<br/>
In the first half of 1981, NASA had quietly informed other international agencies that they had put out a request for proposals regarding a Mars mission. Within the industry, there was much excitement over the prospect of a bigger push towards space than Apollo.  After months of work in the dark, those at NASA’s various centers, Houston, Rockwell, Boeing and Morton Thiokol came forward with the first draft of their proposals for a Mars-focused future. It had not been an easy road to approach this point, countless hours had been spent toiling over these documents in the hopes that it would be appealing to both the scientists at NASA, and their political higher ups. Known as Design Reference Mission 2000, it was a 325 page report detailing plans of a number of comprehensive architectures to get to Mars, at the earliest, by 1994, and the latest, having the first mission bound for Mars by 2000. Skylab had been a lot of things, but it showed that assembly in space was possible, and humans living and working in space was well within reach. The baseline for all of the proposals had leveraged using shuttle and assembling an in space refurbishing and construction facility. This facility would later see expansion into a fully fledged international laboratory, which would help assist NASA and its partner agencies in furthering spaceflight research. Another “must-have” for the Martian architecture would be a place to go on arrival at Mars, a station in Martian orbit that could be ready to receive crews in the event that a landing could not take place, and where they could wait out until the return window opened. The station soon became known as the Mars Base Station, with scientists equating it to the first coastal antarctic bases. This station could also be augmented with modules delivered by arriving and departing crews to enable further space for operations, as well as validate technology in the Martian environment.  The final piece of must haves, a flurry of robotic precursor missions, dubbed semi informally as the “Mars Armada”, would need to be sent ahead of the human landing program to complement the work done by Mariner and Viking, from not just the United States. These vehicles would be essential in gathering as much data as possible about prospective landing sites, Martian weather, and conditions on the surface. International collaboration was strongly advocated for, and instruments from one country could theoretically be flown on another vehicle before the original country’s vehicle was ready. Advancements in manufacturing and rocket technology across the world would enable an international, cooperative effort between seemingly all space faring nations.<br/>
 <br/>
As these numerous organizations came forward, it was clear that there was a major split between the various architectures for a Mars mission; the Transfer Vehicle. Some simpler approaches saw a massive, expendable interplanetary craft that would use chemical stages derived from Saturn V hardware, assembled using a clean sheet design launch vehicle and serviced by Shuttle crews. Another proposal suggested using newly studied ion propulsion for a low energy transfer to Mars, which would reduce the overall size of the spacecraft at the cost of high flight times. The most promising study, however, came in the form of nuclear propulsion, using newly developed densified hydrogen, and experimental lightweight modules to enable high efficiency. NASA’s interest immediately peaked, and engineers and mission planners began to make their assessment. This new type of long term storage would be a tricky one to master, but many within the agency and in engineering circles felt that once that technology could be grappled with, even bolder missions than Mars would be possible. Outside of the transfer element, the other important component would be the lander. The lander, one of the most difficult components of the Apollo program before it, could be split up between nations to minimize cost and ensure that various minds were available to tackle problems. Propulsion for the lander would also be an issue, as Apollo veterans immediately looked to work on a storable design, at the cost of immense weight. Advocates of the cryogenics program were quick to point out that common fuel handling, and the inevitable in orbit refueling that would be required would be best suited to a common propellant type. It was thought that a cryogenic lander could offer more performance and mission flexibility, and avoid caustic fuels damaging the lander’s systems over the projected multi year missions.

The next big challenge would be assembly. Earlier studies of Mars missions had leveraged the immense lifting capabilities of Saturn V or other similar vehicles. However, the move to the Shuttle program had presented both challenges and benefits. The lifting capability of the shuttle, and the relative ease that NASA had with turning the vehicles around meant that modular construction was on the table, rather than the monolithic assembly methods proposed in Von Braun’s Mars studies. However, the limited size of the payload bay meant that the components would be relatively small, extending the construction period, and orbiters would need to be at the ready for a launch and construction campaign. Work on assembling the precursor space station would also enable a "practice run" of assembly techniques for construction of the upcoming Mars ships. All of the Shuttle contractors, in the back of their mind, had always looked to expand the capabilities of the orbiter system, and had drafted proposals for augmentation and modification of the vehicle, without modifying the pad. Several designs came forward, but the most promising was the Orbital Payload Assist Module. The OPAM, as it came to be known, would retain the mounting points of the launch pad, while the payload would ride on top. The engine pod would plug into the pad just as the shuttle would, enabling a common pad structure. This modification led to the acronym SDLV - Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle. This vehicle could leverage the super heavy lift aspects of the Shuttle system without the orbiter, maximizing payload to orbit as well as outsized payloads that would not fit within the shuttle cargo bay. Preliminary design work showed that a system like this could enable cargo of up to 60 tons into orbit, and rumored vehicles being developed in other nations could enable even heavier cargo to be launched - if the political connections could be made. NASA reviewers commented on the commonality displayed on the pad, and the reusability factor of the SDLV system to work in conjunction with their existing shuttle fleet. Coupled with new infrastructure development at the Kennedy Space Center, estimates for up to 40 flights per year were thrown around, more than justifying the cost of these new vehicles and upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
These mission proposals were bold, and expensive, but NASA was in the public’s eye, as images beamed down from flights to Skylab and LEO displayed that human spaceflight was an optimal path forward, and leadership in this field would secure the United States as a prominent power for years to come. But there came another realization, that going alone to Mars would further isolate scientific communities and fail to spread a vision of peace and understanding. A vision of a sustainable future, NASA realized, would be one in which agencies marched into the cosmos hand in hand. The long road now would be assembling these teams, and building the bridges between space agencies to discuss the future of one such program. It was a relatively easy feat to offer a seat on Shuttle to an interested party, compared to the years of political headaches that starting a multi-decade program would be. Deals had to be finalized, industry contracts had to be awarded, and the public of each nation had to be just as on board to ensure continuity. In the words of NASA management, it was akin to herding cats.<br/>
<br/>
The use of satellite navigation, weather satellites, and research conducted on Skylab  was being realized around the world - space research mattered greatly, and advancing human footholds in space as a logical next step to Apollo seemed to be the right path forward. Other countries were realizing this too, and dreams of an international future in space began to circulate in classrooms, government buildings and design labs. Moving swiftly through governments worldwide, the Mars Project seemed to tick the boxes of those who wanted to go higher and faster, making bold discoveries for generations to come. The program was met with public and formal legal approval, and the true work on research, contract assignment and astronaut training could begin. But not before settling on a name, a name that would inspire and ring in the ears of a generation like Apollo would. It would come down to a remark, made by one of the geologists assigned to the program: “To name a mission to Mars Ares feels, well, redundant. Apollo was this godlike figure, and now we as humans are heading to the house of the gods - Olympus if you will… wait, why are you writing this down?” The name Olympus was ultimately selected, and work could begin in earnest on the most complex human spaceflight program in history. </span></p>
