  <div class="calibre20"> </div>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">I</span><span class="calibre6">n Houston, Cologne and Moscow, there was a palpable feeling of fear as the mission control teams pondered the potential loss of crew. Not since <i>Valiant’s</i> untimely end had a control room felt like this, and it was not something that anyone wanted to feel again. The moments that passed inside mission control, as they desperately attempted to reach the crew, were some of the most gut wrenching - a response-less call to a ship that existed in some quantum state. Was it together? Had they called for an abort?  It was made clear that no reports were to be made to the press until the situation was well understood, and the crew could be accounted for. Hours passed, calling to <i>Hera</i> alone in space. The families of the crew had begun to gather, a solemn reminder of the gravity of it all. The first downlinks came in the form of health data from the vehicle, a cascade of issues. As the day unfolded, a most miraculous sound would meet their ears. A tone. The ship had begun to point in the correct attitude to make contact with Earth once more. Hour by hour, flight control teams worked as communications with <i>Hera</i> were painstakingly restored, and it soon became clear what had transpired onboard the stricken MTV all those hours ago. In a series of shaky downlinks, Commander Ivanov and Dr. Delon laid out the gory details of what had happened, the sheer horror of what they had witnessed stunning those on the ground. Taylor and Small had been on EVA, traversing towards the site where the leak had been detected. When Taylor had arrived, he had gotten distracted or disoriented somehow, and his tether wrapped around his glove, forcing him into the coolant pipe, ripping the glove off of his hand and exposing it to the vacuum of space and cryogenic fluids. The leak immediately had worsened, only disorienting Taylor further. In the extreme environment, it had frozen down to the bone almost instantly. Small, who had been riding the robotic manipulator system, unhooked himself and dove for his crew member, acting fast to secure him and attempt to get his glove back on. Taylor had quickly passed out from the pain and hypoxia, and had been dragged to the airlock by Small, buddying his life support system to ensure that he did not potentially suffocate. As they arrived in the airlock, the extent of the damage became clear, and the crew began to realize what had to be done. The medical officer, Delon, had made the call to pull Taylor out of his suit without decompression time, risking the bends and cardiac arrest. Ultimately, his heart would start to slip out of rhythm, and the crew were forced to cut him out of his thermal garment to begin treating him. Soon, he had moved to full cardiac arrest. Small, at this point, remained in his suit, unable to be assisted out due to the rest of the crew being preoccupied, and would stay there for the next two hours. It became clear to the crew how serious the damage was - Taylor’s hand was not savable, and they would need to act fast to amputate. Delon then made the choice, the hardest choice of the whole mission, to call for an abort. The word was his now, in the history of the world’s space programs had no Commander ever been so quickly removed from power, and to the crew, it almost didn’t feel real. Delon would take charge, ordering his crew to secure the ship and prepare for surgery, dismissing Commander Ivanov, and bringing the mission’s dream of landing on Mars crashing down.<br>
<br>
The next 35 minutes moved quickly, and were arguably some of the most chaotic of the mission. Delon had realized that amputation was a necessity, and there were only so many ways that it could be done successfully. Surgery had never been attempted in space before, and the physics of fluid drainage from a living human being were not well known. The crew, desperate for a solution, had made the rather risky call to perform the surgery in one of the mission modules, while under the thrust of the nuclear engines. A plastic bag was thrown into the module to manufacture a makeshift surgical ward, and into it climbed Weir, Delon and Robinson, ready to perform their hardest assignment. The flight deck team would flip <i>Hera</i>, putting her into the correct attitude for a return burn, made possible by Todd Mitchell’s timely transmission not hours before the events of the day had unfolded. With a timer set, they would ignite the Valkyries, ready to push the crew home, and burn to depletion. The ship itself had sustained damage during the ignition of the engines; the arm had not been stowed properly and had separated from the structure entirely. As it tore from the ship, it struck the radiators and solar array on the starboard side, damaging them to the point of failure. Power issues were already starting to creep through their wounded spacecraft, bleeding her vital fluids into the cold expanse of space. Electronics failed, and the maneuver loosened items in the cabin. Their communications array had been damaged in the maneuver, and the coolant leak had worsened. This was of no concern now, as the ship was to expend all of its fuel to get home - they would simply worry about the rest later. It was at this point where, fighting back tears, Ivanov stepped away and Delon took the mic, ready to discuss the details of his medical procedure. The timer running, Weir, Robinson and Delon got to work. They had used a bone saw, scalpel and sedatives to perform the operation, ensuring that Taylor remained in as little pain as possible. They would work quickly, held against the wall by the ever growing pull of gravity, stabilizing themselves as the drop tanks were ditched. The vibrations of the ship would only make their jobs more difficult, gritting their teeth as they attempted to finish, the timer ticking lower and lower. The pull of gravity drained the fluid from their heads, and vertigo soon began to take hold. Delon made a note of how much… more difficult than he thought the removal of Taylor’s wounded hand would be. With Robinson and Weir securing the last stitch, the engines exhausted their slush hydrogen, and the 3 were thrown forward against the opposite bulkhead; tumbling in the silence that now filled the cabin. The module looked like something out of a horror film, blood that had drained from Taylor’s body, now forming into globules, stuck to every surface, floating and bouncing throughout their makeshift surgical space. It clung to their clothes, staining their clothes with a sickly brown. Taylor lay on what was formerly the floor, his body pale, but still alive, oblivious to the iron smell in the room. Delon could not help but begin to weep for the atrocity he had just witnessed, for it was of his own design.<br>
<br>
The next few days were spent attempting to diagnose everything that was wrong with the ship, and ensure that they would be on the right ground track to return home in the next few months. The crew would do their best to keep on a schedule to communicate with Mission Control, and ensure timely and routine communications, despite the circumstances. Cleanup onboard had been painstaking, and Taylor had been delicately moved out of the module and into a secure area in the Habitat. He had remained stable, still sedated and was breathing on his own. His wound remained closed and bandaged, but a problem would soon arise. The crew realized they did not have enough pain medication to treat another crew member if something were to go wrong, nor could they go outside to fix the ship - the condition of the EMU was unknown - no one really knew if they were safe to use. They would be, under the advice of Mission Control, confined to their ship for the next 2 ½ months as they headed for home. Taylor first woke 6 days after the accident, startling the crew. The sounds of panic, flailing limbs and hyperventilation drew them all immediately to him as he tried to undo the straps that held him against the bulkhead. Ivanov could only watch as Weir and Delon attempted to calm him and explain what happened, that there had been an accident and he had been injured. He was inconsolable, screaming and begging to look at what had happened. Gently, Weir would show him his injury, explaining in a slow and calm voice that he had been exposed to space and a coolant line, and there was nothing else they could have done. His delirium was soon replaced with a shaky attempt at focus. Taylor’s next priority fell to the mission at hand, and the state of the ship. Ivanov would interject, claiming that the ship was fine, and they were headed for home - a lie in everyone’s eyes but Taylor himself. He felt the gaze of the crew on him as he moved up to the flight deck, eager to be left alone. Delon, in a private moment with the Commander, would scold him for his lack of honesty. The truth needed to be told, the ship was damaged but safe for now, and there was a lot of work to do to prepare for their return to Earth. Ivanov acquiesced, but felt his control of the mission slipping ever further from his hands. In the end, the crew would vote to keep Taylor mostly sedated, only waking him once every 23 hours to feed him, and limit risk. It was to be a quiet cruise home, one filled with nervous and angry tension, and the hope that <i>Hera</i> could hold on for just a little longer, just to get her crew safely back to planet Earth. <br>
<br>
Their power situation, and the overall safety of the ship remained the most crucial aspect, with the solar panels no longer being able to track the sun. The ship would slowly oscillate, with the remaining healthy panel remaining fully illuminated, and tipping away from the sun during crew sleep periods. The lifeboat was powered on, and put in standby mode. This would ensure that the vehicle would be ready to go at a moment’s notice, ready to carry the crew away from the ship if need be. Communications, as the ship moved closer to Earth, soon became more reliable, and the time delay began to fade, bringing the folks on the ground one step closer to understanding. 3 weeks after the accident, it soon became apparent that the control moment gyroscopes were not dumping heat adequately, rather, they were soaking heat back into the structure, risking failure. The choice was made to shut down two of the CMGs, and rely on attitude control from the reaction control system. <i>Hera</i>, in many ways, was dying. She had limited RCS fuel to work with, and low power operation meant that no additional power than what was absolutely necessary would be available. For much of the journey, the crew would almost exist in a dream-like state, governed by the passing of time on their clocks, desperate to keep their circadian rhythm intact. Falling out of sync with sleep was dangerous here, as they ran the risk of disorientation or even worse, psychosis. After the first month, tensions between Mission Control and the ship grew, and although it brought the crew some comfort to hear their compatriots on Earth grow closer, there was a hint of anger and resentment, particularly from Ivanov. Once heralded as the next great legend of Russian spaceflight, he was doomed to live out his days as a survivor, if he made it back. His anger faded to sorrow, as he sulked around the ship, barely moving and barely exercising. He was growing weak, and he ran the risk of not surviving the acclimation on Earth once he returned. Delon, too afraid to approach the man, would send Weir to do his best to convince him. It worked, just, and Ivanov’s mental health would improve somewhat. But the sight of Taylor would cause him to spiral, a recursive cycle of agony that seemed never ending. In the end, Ivanov would spend most of his time in the Utility section of the ship, eager to be away from the rest of the crew, and most importantly, Taylor.<br>
<br>
On the ground, a familiar face to many at NASA would take her station in the nerve center of Houston. Commander Anna Douglass had become a regular member of staff, doing what she could for the folks in Mission Control, and picking up shifts for those who needed to be with their families. Her presence was comforting for those who had served in the often frantic control center, a seasoned astronaut who knew the ins and outs of systems, and the people flying them. It was under her orders that a psychological evaluation program be sent to the crew, in order to determine their stress levels and help get them home in one piece. She would soon find herself acting as CAPCOM, alongside Mackenzie Walker, the flight director who was in command during the incident on EVA. Concern was mounting over entry corridors and logistics as the ship grew ever nearer. Typhoon season was starting, and NASA’s recovery fleet for an immediate abort had returned to port and had been dispatched for other assignments. The only ship that could potentially be available for such a recovery operation was the USS <i>Abraham Lincoln</i>, which was currently stationed in San Diego. The need for medical personnel on scene would be paramount, and the mission support teams quickly were dispatched to California to begin preparations for the upcoming arrival of the crew. The United States had not conducted a water landing since Apollo, so training had to start somewhere. Then there was the question of Ivanov. As their approach to Earth continued, and his time to lead grew nearer, he had exhibited irrational behavior. He had lashed out at his crewmembers and the ground, the stress of command clearly getting to him. Delon, conferencing late at night with Mission Control, would vote to assign Knowles and Small as Joint Commanders, a memo broken to him by Douglass on a private communications channel. Ivanov was distraught, understandably so, but he soon came to understand the consequences of his actions - he was losing his grip on command, and could no longer function in a way that would lead the mission safely. Knowles and Small would assume command for the remainder of the voyage home, exercising their right to inform Taylor of the situation onboard - he could not help but blame himself. The crew would take their turns, going through their daily activities to ensure that some sense of normalcy remained onboard, doing what they could to care for the dying <i>Hera</i>, and for themselves.<br>
<br>
As the weeks until the crew’s return would turn into days, the NASA team would begin to assign personnel to head out to Hawaii, and subsequently, onto the USS<i> Abraham Lincoln.</i> Cargo flight after cargo flight would transfer personnel onboard, with the lower hangar being set up as a mobile command center. In Houston, Walker would take command of the landing and recovery team, with Douglass stationed on the ship as part of the Welcoming Committee, the group of first responder personnel who would assist the crew out of their capsule. She would make the journey to the carrier in the backseat of an F/A-18, rendezvousing with the ship as they had left for the landing site. The landing on the ship was rougher than she expected, with the fighter slamming its wheels on the deck. She was reminded of the landing on the Martian surface, albeit much more spartan. The desolate and somber greys here couldn’t compare to the reds and browns of Mars… But at least they had the ocean. The flight deck crew would get to work, and she’d soon be out of her jet, and make her way downstairs to start getting ready for the next 40-odd hours to come. The motion of the ship, as they made their way towards the recovery zone, was somehow so alien to Anna, so foreign. In space, there had been no movement to disturb them from slumber, to gently rock them to sleep. She tried to put it out of her mind, and settled into her quarters, ready for the long few days to come. In Houston, Flight Director Walker would take her station, and open the communications loop to <i>Hera</i>: “<i>Hera</i> - Houston, we have you on visual and on charts for entry and splashdown within the next 36 hours. At this time we are moving to section 10-10.2: preparations to abandon ship. Unfortunately, as you know, we have insufficient fuel for capture, due to abort maneuvers conducted after the EVA accident - however, the MTV’s orbital maneuvering system will assist in slowing you all down as much as possible. Next item on our checklist is to prepare the Earth Return Lifeboat and move Chris into the recovery seat, once you complete your final rest period. Our recovery teams are already mobilizing, and we have a ground track for splashdown 100 nautical miles south of Hawaii. We will be performing a dual skip entry to minimize G loading, and will be monitoring your health data as we separate the ERL from <i>Hera</i>. The immediate step after separation will be to conduct the braking and positioning burn, to line you up for our recovery zone. The aircraft carrier <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> will be the immediate recovery ship, supported by USS <i>John Paul Jones</i>. We will be providing real time updates and support to you as you approach, and we’re gonna do all we can to get you home safe.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
Onboard the MTV, the crew began to move their ship into position for the final few hours of flight. The Earth loomed large in their windows, so tantalizingly close. Taylor was woken for the last time, to gaze at the world that he would return to, so help them. Ivanov remained understandably quiet, but communication with the psychologist assigned to the crew as they returned had helped to some degree. With the final dose of sedative administered to Taylor, he would slip into his dreamless sleep, a world between worlds, and the crew could get to work. Their first step was to fire Hera’s orbital maneuvering engines and burn them to depletion, before separating from the ship in their lifeboat. The snort of the maneuvering engines was far more violent than the nuclear engines, causing the dying spacecraft to jolt and shudder. Soon, the ship had exhausted its fuel, and Hera would assume the correct attitude for undocking. One by one, the crew would file into the cramped capsule, and begin to power the vehicle up to operational status. Like some sort of mechanical beast, the displays and systems lurched to life. Taylor was secured in his launch and entry suit, with a special cap over his arm that the crew had manufactured from spare parts. Ivanov would be the last in, taking the time to inspect <i>Hera</i> one last time. The bloodstained modules, the clutter, the low lighting to conserve power, it had been a haunted house of a home - but it had brought them this far. Only one hurdle remained before the kiss of the ocean air would breathe life into them again - entry. After confirming that the lifeboat was powered up, the crew could get to work on sealing the hatches. Robinson and Delon would tend to Taylor, while Knowles, Small and Ayase would work on the hatch. Knowles would take his seat as spacecraft commander, and soon, the two spacecraft were drifting apart, the extent of the damage becoming clear. The solar array and radiator had been clipped by the arm, tumbling off into space. Gashes covered the tanks, and the coolant pipe stuck out from the side of the spacecraft. It felt as though they were staring at a body. As they backed the lifeboat off, and the spacecraft grew smaller, Knowles would say his farewell: “Houston, we’re a good distance away from her now, and we can see her in all her beauty… she really did her best to bring us home, and we’ll forever be in her debt. I hope to see her again someday…” With a puff of the RCS jets, the lifeboat continued its departure, and the MTV, the greatest machine that humanity had ever built, faded into the deep black, ready for her final voyage into eternity. Onboard the dying ship, a drive in a computer whirred, and to no one’s ears, David Bowie’s <i>Life On Mars</i> would play, a moment of solace for the ship, as if reminding her that she had fulfilled her purpose, performed her duty. Godspeed, <i>Hera</i>.</span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
The timer on the mission control clock, and the clock on the USS <i>Abraham Lincoln</i>, slowly were headed towards zero. Not moments before, Commander Douglass had instructed the crew to complete their braking burn, and upon completion, ditch their small service module for entry. The stage was cast off, and the crew was now floating free, bearing down on the green blue marble they called home. Douglass would reach out to them one final time, as they approached the wispy blue atmosphere of planet Earth, ready for their most difficult voyage yet: “O9, this is Commander… This is Anna Douglass… 10 years ago, I found myself ready to face the unknown, landing on a world that no human had yet touched. And now we face a new challenge, bringing the bravest crew I have ever met home from the most perilous ordeal. I may not know much about what lies beyond that plasma blackout, but I do know I’ll be there to see your faces when you’re on the deck. Godspeed, Olympus 9. See you on the other side.” And with that, the call from flight - the lifeboat had entered blackout, consumed by the ionizing plasma that built up around the capsule. In what would become one of the most famous words from the recovery operations, GNC specialist Todd Mitchell would quip: “It’s up to God and the heat shield now… As it always seems to be...” Time seemed to pass even slower, a painful reminder of the tension in the air. 3 minutes went by. Silence, save for the crackle of ambient static. 4 minutes. Tracking planes circled overhead like buzzards. Anna’s foot would tap against the deck, almost in time with the motion of the second hand on her watch.  Expected AOS came and went, and yet, nothing. A call from the flight team went out, desperate for an answer.<br>
<div style="text-align: center"><br>
“Lifeboat, Houston, Comm Check… Lifeboat, Houston, Comm Check.”<br>
A crackle. The call for telemetry from flight controllers, the capsule was in one piece, no word from the crew.<br>
    “Lifeboat, Houston, Comm Check… Lifeboat, Houston, Comm Check.”<br><br></div>Parachutes... Finally! One of the spotter aircraft had seen them, and sailors across the deck were scrambling to race outside to see the ship, and prepare for recovery. A voice pierced the various mission control centers, a voice not heard for some time - Ivanov’s: “Flight… this is Olympus 9. We are on the last mile now, it’s good to be home.” At that moment, the whole world exploded. Tears, hugs, whoops of relief filled control rooms and living rooms. It filled the streets of Hong Kong, the canals of Venice, the fields and great plains and sleepy villages of the western United States. Bells rang in France, and people embraced in Tokyo. In London, Big Ben would chime 9 times, a victory song heard across the city. A kind of joy not felt since the flight of Apollo 13 all those years ago, lifetimes ago, rippled around the world. The lifeboat would drift down towards the water ever so slowly, her orange and white parachutes stood out against the deep blues of the Pacific, an iconic sight for years to come. These men and women, from all over the world, were nearly home, hanging so delicately above the water, and as they slipped into the ocean, their record in history had been sealed - survivors.</span></p>

Somewhere, far away overhead, the mechanical organs of <i>Hera</i> would sigh in relief, and begin her journey around the sun in earnest, her purpose served. Peace at last. </span></p>
