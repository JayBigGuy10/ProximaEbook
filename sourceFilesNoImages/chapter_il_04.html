Anna sat quietly in the front row of the auditorium in Building 2, a place she had come to know all too well. The Houston weather was dreary this afternoon, it had swung from oppressively hot to a torrential downpour in a matter of hours, typical. She reveled in the fact that she did not need to be outside, and that her car was close by. The time of the conference starting had come and gone, she checked her watch, eager to hear what the presenters had to say. This press conference had been nearly 20 years in the making, finally paying off with one grand celebration. Jonathan “Jack” Kissner, the new head of Astrophysics, stepped on stage. This was nerve racking for him, clearly, and Anna watched as the beads of sweat began to pool on his forehead. <i>First rodeo</i>, Anna thought, shifting in her seat, offering a kind smile to Kissner. Rather nervously, he stepped up to the microphone, tapping it gently, and cleared his throat before proceeding.<br>
<br>
“Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. As you all know, for many years, we have been pondering the name of what our next giant leap in the field of astronomy is going to be… and I have the absolute honor of being able to tell you. I stand here today to introduce to you the next revolutionary advancement in international astronomy, one that will enable us to ask new questions about our dynamic universe. But first, I want to discuss some history. Over 160 years ago, a pioneering American woman made the perilous journey to freedom from slavery. Harriet Tubman, one of the bravest women in history, did something extraordinary. Under the cover of night, and using the stars as her guide, she went back. She made the journey on the Underground Railroad over 13 times to rescue those in need and guide them to freedom, and never lost a passenger. Today, we look to the future with the stars as our guide once again, and hope to reflect on our past. With the Harriet Tubman Space Telescope, we will look to the past to inform our questions about our future, and honor the legacy of all of those who had the courage to look to the stars. With this new flagship of astronomy, we will do more than look to the stars, we will ponder the very nature our universe, and blaze a trail forwards towards a greater understanding. As of now, we are tracking a launch for the telescope no later than December, 2017... I'd like to thank you all for your time.”<br>
<br>
The room erupted, and Anna felt herself sink into her seat, admiring the work of this bold young leader. For many years, there had been much internal debate as to what to call this telescope, a powerful symbol of the advancements that international spaceflight was taking. When Anna had joined the corps, it had seemed nearly impossible that a black woman would be commanding the first mission to Mars, in the culture of ex-Air Force hot shots that dominated the field. But now, it would seem, space exploration had made considerable strides in including all - a world that was moving perhaps beyond the prejudices of her youth, towards a greater cosmic understanding that perhaps meant that a united future was possible.  It, for a moment, reminded her of her own age, her own mortality. She had seen such massive change in such a short period of time. She was getting up there in years for the Astronaut Corps, and had wondered quietly if her flight to Horizon would be her last great hurrah… But that didn’t matter now, she had much work to do, stepping up on stage to shake Kissner’s hand and congratulate him on this momentous achievement. He seemed to be more flustered than when he began his speech, not something your every day director could handle. He nervously made small talk, trying his best not to be starstruck in the presence of the Commander. She smiled, and congratulated him on this most historic day. She lingered around the room for some time, admiring the handshakes and embraces, a reminder of the human element that made up this great agency she had called home for so many years. As the evening drew to a close, she found herself walking through the parking lot, still slick with rain - but she didn’t mind - for the sun was shining in Houston once again.   <br>

“Hmmph…Hello, Todd Mitchell speaking…”<br>
<br>
“Mr. Mitchell?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, this him… Sergei- Commander Ivanov, What is it?”<br>
<br>
“Yes - Look, I didn’t know who else to call, we have a situation on our hands.”<br>
<br>
“What do you mean? What kind of situation?”<br>
<br>
“It regards the Chinese asteroid ship.”<br>
<br>
“What the hell do you know, Ivanov? What time is it for you?”<br>
<br>
“That doesn’t matter. I’m on a plane somewhere over the Atlantic - Point is, we have a problem. The Chinese made contact, their solar electric thrusters failed -”<br>
<br>
“Back up. The Chinese made contact?”<br>
<br>
“I have spent an eternity on the phone. Their electric thrusters failed. They’ve got three men stranded somewhere in space near their target asteroid. They’re looking at options. How soon can you be at work? I have data that needs eyes.”<br>
<br>
“Wait - before we go any further… Are they asking for our help?”<br>
<br>
“Yes Todd, they are asking for our help. Get out of bed. Time is of the essence now.”<br>
<br>
“I’m getting up - what do you need me to do?”<br>
<br>
“You need to call Anna. You need to get me in contact with her, and whoever is the flight director right now. The Chinese want to speak with them. They’ve downlinked information for us to review.”<br>
<br>
"Why haven't you called her?"<br>
<br>
"I- I haven't spoken to her in a long time..."<br>
<br>
“But we have no formal relations, doesn’t this need some sort of approval? Brokerage?”<br>
<br>
“Todd, you’re asking too many questions. I’m the broker. I’m wheels down in about four and a half hours, you need to get to work. Let me walk you through the situation…”<br>

<br>
“Anna, thank god.”<br>
<br>
“Mitchell, what do you think you’re doing calling me this late? Are you driving?”<br>
<br>
“We have a situation - it's not one of ours. It’s Baochuan. Something’s wrong. Ivanov is interfacing with the Chinese, he’s got data, you need to get to the center.”<br>
<br>
“Slow the fuck down, Mitchell, the Chinese made contact? This is absurd.”<br>
<br>
“They’re desperate, Commander. They don’t know if they have the supplies to make it back, and they’re using more power than they’re generating on their solar electrics.”<br>
<br>
“Shit.”<br>
<br>
“I called the center and sent them the data. Walker is there, she’s been on the phone with the White House.”<br>
<br>
“Jesus, are we about to cause an international incident?”<br>
<br>
“They’ve invoked Article V of the Outer Space Treaty. They’re asking for help. It’s gone through the political channels already, game time.”<br>
<br>
“They have men out there…”<br>
<br>
“And they want to talk to you about it, Commander. You need to call Ivanov, and get to the center as soon as possible. Tell your husband I’m sorry for the disturbance. Ivanov and the Chinese need to talk to you-”<br>
<br>
“Mitchell, I- Bastard hung up on me!"<br>

“Please pick up... Hello, Sergei?”<br>
<br>
“Anna... It's... It’s good to hear from you, I do wish it were under better circumstances…”<br>
<br>
“We can catch up in a bit, Mitchell filled me in on some of the details, I need to know what we’re working with and how we can help.”<br>
<br>
“Here is what I know, Walker knows this as well, and we’ve gone through our legal channels - about 9 hours ago, the crew of Baochuan activated their solar electric propulsion system to return home, something went wrong. They are still at 2003 TK9 - and it is unclear if they can make it back, or if they have the consumables to do so. There is a group from Beijing headed to Houston now-”<br>
<br>
“Ivanov. You’re telling me they’re on their way now?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, at the White House’s request.”<br>
<br>
“They declared Article V, does that even apply here?”<br>
<br>
“It is not so much the rule itself, but the fact that they are even asking. This is a rare moment in time.”<br>
<br>
“What are we supposed to do? I don't know enough about their mission, their spacecraft, anything… Can we even help?”<br>
<br>
“Anna.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know, Sergei… I don’t know what to do… I cannot move mountains, and I don’t know if I can handle another rescue operation.”<br>
<br>
“Anna!”<br>
<br>
“Do the Russians know more? I need more time, more information…”<br>
<br>
“Anna, listen to me. I am asking you to trust yourself, trust me, and extend a hand to trust them. This is a time critical situation, and I know that you are more than capable of handling this. You saved my life, and I wouldn’t trust anyone else to do the same.”<br>
<br>
“Sergei…”<br>
<br>
“They need you, they need all of us. I have Doctor Liao on the phone, she’s my point of contact. She wants to speak to you directly.”<br>
<br>
“Okay. Thank you Sergei.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you Anna. I’ll see you in a few hours.”<br>
<br>
“Goodbye, my friend.”<br>

<br>
“Commander, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. There is much business to discuss.” </span></p>
