  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">M</span><span class="calibre6">ars would once again come into view, as the crew of Olympus 4 would sail into the sphere of influence of the planet, and begin the long fall as the year 1999 raised its head. <i>Prometheus</i> had performed exceptionally, the lessons learned from <i>Minerva</i> and her crew members had been invaluable in learning how to live and work in space. The first sighting of Mars, now far more expected, was marked with celebration, and a downlink packet from the crew would commemorate their arrival, the second in a series of great achievements for the Olympus Program. Commander Teller, making use of the new IMAX cameras, would showcase the long fall towards the planet, in a documentary being filmed in collaboration with National Geographic. The crew had also demonstrated several on the fly repair techniques, as two out of six life science racks experienced faults during cruise. This kind of maintenance, practiced onboard Odyssey, would come as second nature, and the crew were able to preserve the critical experiments onboard. After many months of transit, the planet Mars would loom large in their cupola window, and the Base Station would establish stable uplink and downlink rates. Orbital insertion would be certainly less eventful than it had on Olympus 3, the crew hoped. On March 27th, the crew would strap themselves into their acceleration couches, and prepare for the coming burn. Turning of the keys would once again light the Valkyries of <i>Prometheus</i>, bringing to life a great beast that had been quiescent for so long. The vehicle rattled and groaned as the force of acceleration pushed the astronauts further into their couches, and the solid tone of the flight computer would indicate a clean tank separation. The vehicle, now only on its core stage, would continue to break for orbit, the geiger counter onboard ticking ever so gently, a comforting reminder that all was well. The electronic eyes of the orbiter fleet would train their sensors on the incoming ship, waiting and watching, catching the glow of the spacecraft against the cold, lifeless background of the planet. The flight computer, detecting minor variations, would command the RCS to fire, keeping the engines and ships inline as they continued the last few moments of the burn. With a healthy tone from the spacecraft’s flight computer, the engines would shut off, and the OMS system would begin to pulse, correcting their orbit as they began to orbit the planet as a true satellite. It was a moment of triumph, humanity’s second crew now orbited the Red Planet, captured in a safe and secure orbit. <i>Corvus</i>, having also completed successful orbital insertion, would begin the task of lining up to dock with the Base Station, aggregating all of the components of Olympus 4 at their predestined positions. The Base Station and MTV would soon lock eyes with one another, and begin the process of docking. Humanity’s system for travel to the Red Planet, one of the most expensive projects of all time, worked in repetition, no longer the dream of science fiction writers. The crew, boarding their home away from home, would begin to make preparations for their landing at Isdis Planitia, scheduled for the Fall. The second expedition to the Red Planet was well and truly underway.</span></p>

The months of Olympus 3’s transit dragged on, but the image of Earth, filling their viewscreens and subsequently their window, was their allowed moment of respite, a moment to rest and a moment to weep. It had been a long road, getting here, and the time for joy could once again be felt, no longer was the crew surrounded by an air of tension that governed their actions. Home, once a distant point of light in the sky, now sat, blue and green and white in front of them. It was, in all respects, a homecoming unlike any had ever seen before. The spring in the Northern Hemisphere had turned to summer, and lush greens could be made out from their scopes. Soon, their arrival would loom large, and the tired crew would prepare the ship for the events that were coming. The arrival burn, a long, complicated endeavor, would push the vehicle to its limits on acceleration, with the fuel on the MTV running the lowest that it had during its entire service life. Preparations were also made, as they grew ever closer, to activate the Earth Return Lifeboat in the unlikely event that <i>Minerva</i> could not complete the burn, allowing the lifeboat to return the 8 crew members on a direct entry, while still slowing down as much as possible. It was a possibility they had trained for, but as the mission was planned, reuse of the MTV core was always the preferred option. Fatigue was starting to eat away at the crew, but the now more frequent communication with Mission Control brought some relief. They had done remarkably well at following their routine, exercising regularly to stave off bone density loss, and eating well. Still, the pull of Earth’s gravity would exhaust them after two and a half years in space, and medical teams on the ground were doing all they could to prepare for Olympus 3’s homecoming. Intrepid stood ready on the pad, preparing for the great leap into orbit as she waited to bring the crew home to Earth, ready to walk on the soil of their homeworld once more. Soon, the Earth would loom large in their windows, and the crew would make their way to the flight deck to prepare for orbital insertion.</span></p>

  <i>Slipping across the terminator, Minerva and the crew of Olympus 3 would arrive home. Their historic mission drawing to a close, they would return to a hero's welcome, and a fundamentally changed planet Earth.</i>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
July 19th would see the crew, falling rapidly towards the planet Earth, make preparations to come home. For nearly 3 years, they had been in space, on another world, and most importantly, on the adventure of a lifetime. The journey, however, was not quite over. The crew, now strapped into their acceleration couches, would get ready to fire the Valkyrie engines one final time. The eyes of the world, now familiar with the great feeling of walking on other worlds, would watch once more, as the people in mission control milled about, counting down the hours until the final burn. Time seemed to pass much slower in these moments, as the world watched. Soon, the hours would turn to minutes, and the crew, tired from their journey, would turn the keys for the control drum actuators to move one final time. The Valkyrie’s response was immediate, pushing the crew into their seats with greater force than ever before as the vehicle used up what fuel remained. The vehicle, like the crew, seemed tired, and new noises accompanied the ever familiar click of the geiger counter as the Earth moved under their feet. Minerva continued to do what she always did, her job, and damn good job of it she did. The vehicle shuddered and groaned as the RCS and gyroscopes kept the ship in line, pressing the crew into their seats further and further. On their flight control screens, a familiar light: CAPTURE CONFIRM, but this was only one step of many. The Valkyries continued to push, and the reading on fuel levels continued to drop. Their apogee, for so long just a number on their flight instrumentation to ignore, was now dropping, bringing their orbit lower and lower, until finally, the engines would shut off for the final time, and the crew would be left in the silence of the moment. Unbuckling from their seats, they quickly moved to the windows of the great ship, observing the planet in all its majesty. <i>Intrepid</i>, poised for launch since <i>Minerva’s</i> entry into Earth’s sphere of influence, would finally leap off the pad, carrying its support crew to a rendezvous with the fatigued but victorious crew. The hatch opening, filmed from a camera mounted in the docking tunnel, was a moment of triumph. The Olympus 3 crew, wearing the jumpsuits they had departed in, would move through the hatch, colliding into embrace with their retrieval crew. The first human crew, fresh from the arms of the Red Planet, once again with their earthling compatriots. The Olympus 3 crew, as jovial as they looked, seemed tired, and knew that their period of readjustment on Earth would be one of many hurdles still to face them. <i>Minerva </i>and <i>Intrepid</i> would coast back to the orbital neighborhood of Odyssey, <i>Zarya</i> and <i>Hera</i>, still undergoing refit for its deployment to Venus later in the year. Soon, the crew of Olympus 3 would say goodbye to their great ship, ready to be embraced by the arms of loved ones on the planet below. Commander Douglass would be the last through <i>Minerva’s</i> hatch as they prepared the orbiter for departure, finally bringing to a close this epic voyage. In a last minute decision, she would remove her name tag from her flight suit, and slip it into a locker onboard the MTV, a piece of herself to always remain in space.  <i>Intrepid</i> would come to a twilight stop at the Kennedy Space Center, bringing with it the first ever human crew to return from another planet - triumphant, exhausted, and captivating in the eyes of billions of people around the world. It was done, humans had walked on their second world, and Olympus 3 was only the beginning.</span></p>

  <i>The mission patch for Olympus 5V, the first crewed mission to the Veiled Planet.</i>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
In orbit, final preparations were being made to <i>Hera</i> in preparation for her mission to the veiled planet Venus. Fueling operations had taken double the time required for a Mars sortie, and assembly crews had their hands full in preparation for departure, securing the tanks and equipment to the exterior of the ship. The crew of Olympus 5V, moving as quickly as they could through their training, would soon enter final quarantine before launch, a slimmed down complement of astronauts from all across the Olympus Partnership. Their commander, George McMaster, was a former <i>Valiant</i> flier who had returned to NASA after originally training to fly onboard the shuttle in the mid-80s. The MTV pilot, Maxime Martel of ESA, had been a Dassault test pilot, his work critical to development of the Mirage series of fighter jets. Russia’s Gennady Morozov would act as the flight surgeon for this mission, having trained the previous flight surgeons before him. Hideki Yoshioka of NASDA would be the first mission specialist, and payload deployment officer onboard, helping to conduct experiments pertaining to planetary science and heliophysics. NASA’s Millie Laurence and Steven Chang Arnold would fly as Mission Specialists 2 and 3, enabling research and observation of this alien new world. <i>Atlantis</i> would launch the crew of Olympus 5V in September, as Intrepid entered a planned period of maintenance. They would dock with the MTV on November 7th, 1999, and prepared to move crew and cargo over from the orbiter. One of their first tasks was an EVA, to install 3 probes provided by the Russian State Space Agency, ESA, and NASA, to be deployed at Venus. The first, the Cytherean Lofted Ultralong-range Explorer, or CLUE, was a balloon probe built by NASA to explore the turbulent upper atmosphere of the planet. The Venus Infrared Scanning And Geology Explorer, VISAGE, was an ESA built orbiter with the aim of complementing work done by Magellan, to help decode the geological features on the planets surface. The Russian State Space Agency would contribute Venera-C1, a repurposed flight spare designed to make it to the surface of the planet. The three spacecraft, stored snug against the body of the MTV, would soon see their destination before their very eyes.</span></p>

  <i>Under the thrust of her three Valkyrie engines, Olympus 5V breaks orbit and heads to the planet Venus, meeting a rare window to orbit this long misunderstood world. The Delta V requirements for this mission would necessitate a series of drop tanks and complex staging maneuvers.</i>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
On Thanksgiving day, 1999, the crew of Olympus 5V would be pressed into their seats as the engines of the great spacecraft broke them free of Mars orbit, pushing them higher and faster, and closer to the sun than any human being before them. They would soon see the Earth begin to fall away from them, as their strange vehicle carried them ever closer to a veiled world. The transit of 150 days would be fast, much faster than the up to 7 month transfers of the outbound Mars missions. Since the age of Apollo, the idea of a Venus mission had captivated the space agencies of the world, and with the age of Olympus now in full swing it finally felt like the time. The goal of the mission, as they spent their 30 days in orbit of Venus, would be to gather as much information about the planet as possible, and examine the benefit of orbital campaigns to a planet whose surface was too inhospitable to land on. <i>Hera</i> herself would act as a testbed, experimenting with the utility of the MTV as a command center for uncrewed spacecraft, something the Olympus partners had been considering for asteroid exploration, as well as debuting upgraded life support and water recycling racks. Within the various NASA centers around the country, work was well underway on the next generation of space probes, missions that would push the boundaries of mission design and spaceflight as a whole. The latest flagship, known only as JOME - The Jovian Moon Explorer, would debut new technologies like multi mode propulsion to explore the mini solar system around the gargantuan world.  Several small probes would be deployed from the vehicle to explore in great detail the microcosms of the moons of the planet. Planned for launch tentatively in 2005, this grand tour had a design life of nearly 20 years, and would complement the work already being done by Galileo. Cometary exploration had become a point of discussion for the European Space Agency, and their success with Giotto had inspired them to take the lead in planning their latest mission to 67P Churyumov/Gerasimenko, discovered in the 1960s by Ukrainian astronomers. Their mission, Persephone, would see an orbiter travel to the icy world in 2004, and deploy a sample return lander which would allow for cometary regolith to be brought back to Earth, stored in a closed loop cooling system to preserve ice from the comet. From Goddard Space Flight Center, in partnership with CNES, Solar Sentinel, or SolSen, was being developed to learn more about humanity’s star, the Sun using a unique shielded design. All of these missions, as well as the work done by the Olympus program, enabled humanity to learn more about the Solar System, and truly bring about a second renaissance of scientific understanding. </span></p>
