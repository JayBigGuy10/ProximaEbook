  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">I</span><span class="calibre6">n the immediate hours after the landing, the crew would make contact once again with their colleagues on the Base Station, providing vital data about the descent, and steps to come. Despite the rather violent entry procedure, their intrepid ship had performed well, and all of the health checks would come back satisfactory. As they recovered from the strain of gravity, they’d remove their armored launch and entry suits and start to set up their home away from home. Their immediate priority would be the deployment of the Power Rover, a small, nuclear power plant that would trundle away from the vehicle, parking itself in a crater nearby to safely generate power for the crew, and isolate the crew from harsh radiation. On future long stay missions, this rover would be joined by modules already positioned on the ground, powering and supplying the whole base for the 500 days that the crew would remain on the surface. For now, and the Olympus 3 crew’s 41 day stay on the surface, this intrepid little rover would be all that they would require. The first day and a half would be spent letting the crew adjust to the lighter gravity of Mars, which for the first few hours, was brutal. Breathing hurt, climbing up and down the ladders of the hab deck was strenuous, and the crew was advised to take it easy. From their vantage point on the flight deck, the crew could look at the landscape that awaited them, and start to coordinate with the Base Station about their first EVA activities. The internal space of the lander was not the most roomy, but it would be comfortable for the time the crew spent on the surface. It was split into 3 decks, divided by bulkheads, and was designed for maximum utilization of space. The forward most deck was the flight deck, remarkably similar to the Shuttle flight deck in many aspects. Below this was the Hab/Lab, a combination living and working space, relatively spacious in volume, afforded by the 5m diameter of the stage. A deck lower than the Hab/Lab was the suit port deck, a split compartment, with 8 doors for the eventual full crew to the surface. <i>Zephyr</i> was many things, but a comfortable space for 8 crew members? Not exactly. The plan was, as it stood, to convert the LOX tank on the descent stage into a 7m habitat for the crew, a comfortable home away from home that could be augmented with additional modules for a stay of up to 500 days. For now, the volume of <i>Zephyr</i> would be more than enough to handle the job at hand.<br>
<br>
On Sol 6 on the surface, the crew would make the journey down the internal ladders of the lander to the suitport deck, where they would begin the process of suiting up. First came the cooling garment, a strange contraption covered in hoses that would help to regulate the body temperature of the space walkers as they traversed the surface. In simulations, they had many anxious technicians to help them, scurrying around them like insects and inspecting every joint. Now, it was just them, alone on a planet, following the checklists those same technicians had left them. To break the tension of what they were doing, music filled their ears over the speakers of the lander, serenading them with classical music, a comforting reminder of the people back home. The final piece would be the Snoopy Cap, a device containing the headset and microphones needed for the crew to communicate. Flipping a switch on the bulkhead, the fans of the suit would come to life, and 4 of the 8 doors would open, revealing the complex mechanisms and padding of the suit inside. One by one, the crew of the landing team would climb into their suits, testing their uplinks with each other, and with the Base Station in orbit. Soon, the doors in their backpacks would swing closed, and the outer door would separate from the suits, allowing the crew to take their first steps in the ARES suits. The door of the suitport deck would soon slide open, and the crew could step onto the elevator, a cable hoisted platform deployed from the side of the lander in the days prior. Staring out over the horizon, the crew could take in the first vistas of Mars from the top of the lander, even making out the distant peak of Elysium Mons. The elevator would carry the crew down, slowly and carefully, and soon, the red dust of mars would be merely inches away. The crew could do not much more than stare, the world before them, an entire world for humanity to discover, sat beyond a minute threshold. There was, in their mission planning, a supposed order for how the crew members would step off the elevator, with Commander Douglass being the first human to step off the lander onto this terra nova. But, as they stood there, admiring the great expanse of this hostile world, they knew what to do. Filming from their helmet cams, the crew would grab each other's hand, and take the first steps for humanity together.<br>
<br>
The first hour of the EVA consisted of mostly mundane tasks, walking around and checking out the lander, identifying potential issues with the landing site, and deploying equipment. One of the first pieces of equipment was a camera, a clunky setup to prevent degradation in the hostile environment of Mars. Unlike the bold lighting on the moon, the environment of Mars was not the most flattering. The crew members did not mind, their suits had identifying flags, and it became easy to see to the crew in orbit who was who. As they spent these first hours on the surface, they were able to familiarize themselves with the operation of the ARES suits, which featured new heads up displays to assist the spacewalkers with their operations. After two and a half hours, the crew could begin the flag planting ceremony, with each member of the crew assembling and planting their representative flag on the edge of a small crater that bordered the landing site. The flags of Australia, Canada, Russia and the United States stood proudly, the first markers of human origin on another world. The crew would make the trek back to the lander, fetching a special container. They would return to the flags, and take great care to open it. Within it, a small, black plaque, containing the inscription: In Memoriam, the crew of OF-19, the final flight of Valiant, <i>In Aspera Ad Astra</i>. The plaque would also contain the identifiers of their own flight, so that one day, hopefully, someone would take a moment to pause at this very spot. Commander Douglass would then turn the camera towards the crew and flags, and deliver her remarks to the world. “This is Commander Anna Douglass, speaking to you from <i>Valiant’s</i> Landing, Elysium Planitia, on October 16, 1997. We, as human beings from nations all over the world, have made the great voyage to Mars, not in the spirit of antagonism, but in the spirit of togetherness and cooperation. Not even 30 years ago, the countries of those who serve on this crew, who I consider some of my closest friends, were locked in a battle of ideology that kept us divided. Together, we have taken the steps to get here. It was not an easy road to get here, there are those we lost on the way, and who’s memories we will keep in our hearts in every step on the Martian surface. We honor them today in the naming of our landing site, and will carry them with us into the ever bolder future. Thank you.” This was followed by a moment of silence, as Maksimov and Bromley lay a folded flag next to the plaque, and the cameras were turned off for a private moment alone. As they stood there, on an alien world, Anna could not help but let a tear roll down her cheek. Soon, the fatigue of the spacewalk would start to eat away at the crew, and they would make their way back into the lander, nearly collapsing into their bunks as soon as they could. It had been a long and exhausting first day, but none of them could sleep, truly ecstatic with the prospect of the days to come.</span></p>

Sol 7 would see the crew venture outside once again, still sore from the previous day’s activities, and carefully begin to unpack their cargo. First, and most importantly, would be the six wheeled Mars Roving Vehicle. Built on the lessons learned from the Lunar Roving Vehicle before it, the vehicle would be an open top, robust exploration vehicle with a range of 60 km, far more than their EVA rules would allow. It had, more importantly, a trailer that would allow them to carry additional cargo. Assembly would take only an hour and a half, and the crew could begin driving the vehicle around the lander, eager to test their capabilities. The crew would report to the base station that the rover handled well, and the Martian gravity provided no difficulty in using the vehicle. Soon, the crew could set out to encounter the intrepid little explorer that had come before them, <i>Marie Curie</i>. The lander had spent her two years on the surface conducting weather observations, and communicating with the armada of spacecraft above her. It was a lonely existence, but one that afforded the crew a safe landing on the surface. The lander’s legs, as the crew approached after the 1.5km drive, had been covered in dust, easily blown away by bursts of compressed air carried by the crew. The lander’s door opened to reveal a plethora of cargo, science instruments and notes from the lander’s manufacturer. They would work quickly to bring the experiments back to the lander, and start to set up the Surface Command Station, a small platform where the crew could stage their scientific operations out of. Their first experiments would be a geological suite, a mineral analysis sensor, and weather monitoring station, designed to enable the crew to gather a full range of knowledge about their environment. The geology station would enable the crew of Olympus 3 to perform experiments regarding planetary scale physics, being the first of many such stations. In the following days, the crew would conduct geological expeditions, and begin the quest to identify signs of water and life on the planet’s surface. They would, themselves, act as guinea pigs for human habitation of the planet, as there was no reference to compare human experience. The crew would keep detailed logs, discussing their daily habits and feelings, as well as detailed measurements on their bodies. These had a certain degree of excitement to them, after all, they were the first medical logs on another world!<br>
<br>
In orbit, the crew was preparing for an exciting set of operations of their own. Onboard their MTV, <i>Minerva</i>, they had brought with them a series of small probes and impactors designed to help answer questions about the Red Planet. The first probe to be deployed, the Mars Magnetospheric Observer, would use a small solid stage to power it into an eccentric, inclined orbit, to start mapping the planet’s magnetosphere; or lack thereof. Studies of the planet remained inconclusive, regarding the apparent lack of the planet’s magnetic shielding, and the geologically dead core. Questions still remained, when comparing Mars with the Earth, about how the planet came to be in its current state, and could its current condition hint at why the planet appeared dead, biologically. This probe would drift away from the MTV base station complex, cast into the growing ecosystem of robots around the Red Planet. The remaining probes had one destination in mind, the Martian surface. An EVA conducted by Shoemaker and Koch would remove the covers of the first impactor, the Mars Seismic Explorer, and work with the robotic arm to position it for deployment. After successful installation, the crew would move back inside, and cast the vehicle off from the complex. This vehicle had less in common with exploration vehicles, and more in common with nuclear missile warheads; the vehicle was essentially a simple kinetic impactor coupled to a small bus for maneuvering. After a series of maneuvers from reaction jets, the vehicle would perform a deorbit maneuver, before igniting a small solid motor, powering the vehicle towards the surface in hopes of generating a large impact crater, and a reading that could be measured by the crew. The vehicle would streak through the Martian sky, heading towards an impact with the planet. To no one’s ears, the vehicle would strike the surface with a deafening thump, leaving behind a fresh scar on the planet’s surface. Operations in orbit, for the month and a bit the crew was on the surface, were relatively similar to operations at Odyssey, with time spent taking care of their spacecraft, observing the world below them, and communicating with their away team. It was a quiet time, and the crew worked largely at their own pace, making sure to document their movements. They missed their colleagues on the ground, and a small part of them envied the task of landing on the surface, but they knew that there was a job to be done, and important work was still to come to get all of them home.<br>
<br>
Soon, the crew of <i>Zephyr</i>, tired and battered from their 41 days of operations on the surface, would climb into their ascent stage, seal the doors and don their armored launch and entry suits. The landing team, in an anxious state not felt since their departure from Earth, sat in silence as the countdown on their flight instruments moved towards zero. These moments, these last precious moments, would be the last in which the crew could view the relative safety of the Martian plains, so vast, yet somehow so familiar to the crew who had spent their time there. In the final few seconds, Commander Douglass would reach out and grip St. Michel’s hand, before securing herself in her seat. Amidst the great silence of the Martian Desert, the vacuum of noise which had been the dominant force for some thousands of years was no longer the champion. The panels which contained the ascent stage would be blown away by the force of the solid motors, kicking the vehicle into the air, settling their propellant for their upper stage engine to ignite. Their vehicle would cast off from the surface of the planet, their LE-57M  powering them into orbit, pitching and rolling to the proper ascent attitude. It was a rough ride, the thrust of the engine pushing them into their seats. but the silence that greeted them when finally in orbit offered them a moment of peace. They were free from the pull of Mars’ gravity, and the Ascent Stage of the lander seemingly had more to give. The engine had performed better than expected, and the crew would make note of this additional performance. The coast and subsequent rendezvous would be swift, and soon, the crew of Olympus 3 would be whole once more. In what had felt like ages, would open the hatches between the Base Station and <i>Zephyr</i>, and like they had done on their departure from Earth, would silently embrace, happy to be one cohesive unit again. The lander's ascent stage, having done its job dutifully, would be cast away into the inky blackness of space, its mission completed for all of humankind. The remainder of their time in orbit around the Red Planet would be spent observing the moons of Phobos and Deimos, and deploying a small sample return mission. This mission, sponsored by the Russians, would see a small menagerie of spacecraft scuttling around the moon, eager to learn more about this strange rocky world.  </span></p>

Back on Earth, the reaction to the crewed landing, and the subsequent operations on and around Mars was astounding. As the first landing could not be televised live, the images and videos that came out of mission control would be relayed much later, allowing time for careful curation of the international effort. In Times Square, people gathered to watch the first steps, in European capitals across the continent, a moment of silence was held for the fallen astronauts onboard Valiant, and schoolchildren everywhere watched awestruck as science would be conducted on the surface. Olympus 3 was the calling of a generation, and what had happened earlier with the Shuttle program would happen again, scores of young minds eagerly approached the field of Aerospace and Engineering, to bring a new and even more prosperous tomorrow within their grasp. They were the Olympus Generation, and the impact of humanity on Mars was felt all over the world. Every downlink brought with it new excitement and anticipation, simply waiting for the wonders that Mars would show them. Countries and organizations all over the world were eager to join the program, to be part of something bigger. The success of the climb to orbit brought a great deal of excitement for those at NASA, the systems they had worked so hard on had worked, and worked well. Within the Olympus planning office, there was even more work to be done. The next several windows, including the planned Olympus 5V mission, would make use of the system as it existed now, with Olympus 7 being the first long stay mission in the roster. The long stay missions would see two logistics modules delivered to the surface well ahead of the crew, coupled with the Logistics Lander, which had already proven its worth to the crew. It was a daring endeavor, to be sure, and would rely on experimental conversion of a spacecraft designed to work on another world, but it was an important step into permanent habitation on the Red Planet. </span></p>
