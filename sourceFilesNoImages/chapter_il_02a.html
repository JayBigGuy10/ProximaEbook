  <div class="calibre20"> </div>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all!, This week, we're going to be recapping the really exciting sequence outlined in this week's Interlude, the landing of crew on the surface of Mars on Olympus 3! I really wanted this section to highlight kind of the raw emotions that go into the whole thing. I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> for providing these amazing images of descent, and really capturing the raw emotion of the whole thing. I also want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/4possumsinacoat" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Peter</a> for providing some incredible stuff for the MSAV's abort modes, which he took the time to detail so well. I'll include the abort mode diagram at the end of the annex. Peter also did a great job coming up with the diffuser for the center engine, which allows us to minimize dust kick-up during descent and avoids creating a crater under the lander. I hope you all enjoy!</span></p>

  <i>Zephyr begins atmospheric interface, scraping the tenuous atmosphere of the planet Mars. An entry burn shortly after would mitigate heating and enable the crew to arrest their horizontal velocity, key to translating to the surface.</i>

  <i>Zephyr deploys her ballute, an inflatable drag balloon to help further arrest the horizontal velocity of the lander. The ballute helps to bring the lander under supersonic speeds, and is supported on the lander body by a specially designed bridle.</i>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi everyone!, I hope you all enjoyed our interlude last week, and are excited about what's to come. We're officially in the second half of Proxima now, that's so very exciting! I can't wait to bring so many more exciting stories to the forefront as we learn about the solar system. I wanted to thank two spectacular folks this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/salyutseven" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ben</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a>, who've delivered some amazing shots for us. I really can't wait to go even further. As for the way the story will be going, we'll definitely see an increase in missions, and return to some old friends who've not seen in quite some time!<br>
<br>
I also wanted to include the first musical number for Proxima, also written by Ben, which you can listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAOY0GGF9nw" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here (youtube.com/watch?v=LAOY0GGF9nw)</a>.<br>Headphones STRONGLY reccomended.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let's get on with Chapter 9!</span></p>
