  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">T</span><span class="calibre6">he crew of Shenzhou 8, in the last few minutes of their free flight, would approach their target - the Tiangong 1 station hanging in low Earth orbit. It had been a fast rendezvous, the fastest done by any Chinese crew thus far, setting a record at 6 hours. The crew of Shenzhou 7 had shown the world that China was ready to take the steps into orbital construction and expansion, and now, test resupply. 3 days after docking with the small complex, a second Long March 2F would be rolled out to Launch Area 4. Atop this vehicle sat a vehicle not too dissimilar from the station itself, a modified pressure vessel and bus that would carry cargo to the upcoming space station. As the crew passed over the launch site, they would watch as the vehicle soared skywards, casting off its boosters and stages, and waited patiently as the Tianzhou vehicle made its approach. Lining itself up on the aft docking port, a pulse of its RCS would place the two vehicles firmly together, nose to tail. Over the next several hours, the crew would work at opening the hatches, preparing to move into the cargo spacecraft and unload supplies, as well as set up experiments delivered to them aboard this experimental vehicle. Their stay would end up lasting 4 months, setting a new record for Chinese operations in space. During this time, they would complete a number of activities, including practicing orbital maintenance, EVAs, and modular assembly of internal spacecraft components. However, the crew of Shenzhou 8 would be the last to visit the nascent space complex. After their undocking, the cargo ship that remained attached would push the station into a lower orbit, letting the station fall into the grip of the atmosphere. Tiangong-1, the first in hopefully a long line of Chinese achievements, was no more, but at the Wenchang Launch Center, preparations were already underway to launch its successor in the coming years, Tianhe. <br>

Elsewhere on the ground, plans for the next generation of stations were starting to take shape. Odyssey had been a shining example of the work crews could do when they had direct access to a spacecraft, but the idea of combining a lab and a servicing facility was running into issues. Payloads in the laboratory modules were sensitive to vibrations, and had to be switched off when work was being done on the truss or on spacecraft docked to the station itself. Odyssey was also limited in its size, and the unusual arrangement for assembling MTVs had its drawbacks. As the station aged, engineers began working on plans to construct not one, but two new stations to meet the needs of the Olympus partners. The first element of this plan would be a smaller, more function-forward station known as the Gateway Platform. Made up of 3-5 modules, as well as a solar power truss, it would be considerably smaller than the station it would be partially replacing. Unlike Odyssey, this station would not be permanently crewed in continued rotations, rather, it would be crewed when humans were required - in such instances as working on an MTV or repairing a spacecraft. For simpler operations, such as refueling and aggregation, a new breed of robotic arms would adorn the complex, servicing spacecraft and performing repairs. Joining the Gateway Platform would be a new set of tugs, known as OMVs, which would move through orbits to collect and service satellites. The station itself was also mobile, utilizing newly refined ion engines to maneuver to different orbits. With enough lead time, this could enable the station to perform inclination changes and service a variety of satellites. The second, and further down the road element of this plan would be the Large Diameter Core Modular Station. During the construction of Odyssey, Jupiter-OPAV had not been available to launch outsized modules into orbit, ultimately limiting the size of modules to what could be carried in the cargo bay of the shuttle. That would change with the LDCMS, with the central module taking full advantage of the 8.4 meter diameter of the Jupiter-OPAV External Tank. This massive structure would be flanked on the forward and aft ends by European node modules, connecting to partner modules and allowing for visiting spacecraft to dock. Above it, a massive truss would connect to the 4 powerful solar arrays, and contain such experiments as an alpha magnetic spectrometer and climate change monitoring radar. The central module would contain all of the propulsion elements, core life support, and habitation for the planned 12-16 crew members, and be serviced by the Shuttle and other available crew vehicles. These new stations would herald a monumental change in operations in LEO, further democratizing space and opening the cosmos up for all humankind - a core philosophy for all those who worked on the program.  </span></p>

  <i>The crew of Olympus 8 make their arrival burn onboard Prometheus at the Red Planet, ready to make history as humanity's second long stay crew.</i>

For the crew of Olympus 8, settling into their operations on Mars had been a piece of cake. Their arrival had coincided with the tail end of dust storm season, so the choice was made to hold off on the landing for a few weeks until the storms would calm, and the crew could make the descent to the landing site in peace. Their arrival at Jezero would be the ultimate test of the landing technologies used to make these missions possible, targeting ever narrowing landing ellipses to put them down precisely where they needed to be. Their landing was flawless, with their lander, <i>Lynx</i>, carrying the crew to within half a mile of their pre-positioned supplies. Dust storm season saw a layer of fine powder deposited atop their supplies, and the crews made sure to clean them off before they began the journey back to outfit their lander for the long stay. The first few months would see the crew sticking relatively close to their lander, performing scientific analysis of the dry lakebed they had landed on. As they began to venture further and further out, the scientific objectives only got more interesting. A series of sedimentary outcroppings were some of the first sites the crew visited, walking along the rim of the crater. The crew would then trek, by rover and foot, to an outflow, leading out of the basin and into the hilly, cratered region beyond. It would only be when, as they were scaling this slope, Mission Specialist Ikuta would slip, and put his hands out in front of him to brace his fall. He landed uninjured, but his impact onto the surface revealed something hidden below a layer of dirt, something glinting in the midday sun - water ice. The crew immediately dropped what they were doing, and rather ungracefully, shoved Ikuta out of the way. Mensen would transmit back to the crew at their basecamp, some of the most historic words said on Mars: “At the price of a stumble, we may have secured humanity’s next giant leap!” The crew would get to work in this region, identifying any other sources of water ice and looking for potential aquifers, signs that the planet may still have flowing water in some way shape or form. It seemed, at least in this region, that the ice would force its way out of the ground with pressure alone, indicating that some kind of process remained active below the planet’s surface. Ice samples were also brought back to the habitat for further analysis, working in very carefully sealed biosafety environments. There was a moment, as they poked and prodded and melted these ice samples, where the crew felt it necessary to prepare themselves for the possibility of finding something alive, something wriggling around in this water that no one had previously considered. Their analysis would bring back no definitive results, but it did lead to further clues about the nature of water on the planet during its past.</span></p>

Activities on the planet’s surface would continue in the form of the establishment of an experimental construction site, not far from the crew’s habitat. As space agencies looked towards the future of human exploration, the consideration of how to build more permanent homes on the planet had to be considered. For the crew hab, part of their work was insulating the whole system with water bags and equipment, a quick option that allowed for their water storage to not take up space and protect them from radiation they would experience on the surface. Several ideas for a more permanent solution, in the interest of outpost building, had been discussed and would be demonstrated on upcoming Olympus missions. The first, and arguably most experimental test, would be dubbed Operation Sandcastle, the assembly of a model village to test systems for the future of humans on the planet. On sol 231, they would unpack a small equipment kit, including a rover affectionately named “Trunks” (named for a flexible proboscis used to print structures), who would create a series of structures out of the dusty regolith. By combining the soil with a small amount of setting agent, they were able to create a durable concrete like material that could hold up well to the erosive winds of the planet. As Trunks worked, the crew would place dosimeters inside each of the designs, aiming to measure the effect of this new rad shielding. To their surprise, the 3D printed shelters would prove even more resilient than expected, shielding the dosimeters well with very little setup. As news of this discovery broke to those on the ground, mission planners could only begin to start planning what a more permanent facility on the planet would look like. The inflatable habitats launched onboard the MTVs, having been tested extensively in space, looked to be a solution to base building. While not much lighter than conventional modules, they could be arranged in more complex shapes, and delivered flat packed to landing sites by cargo landers. Prestaged robotic teams, perhaps upgraded forms of Trunks, would be used to cover the modules in this regolith concrete. It would not be the most glamorous process, but it helped to ensure the astronaut’s safety on the surface - the end goal of every mission planner. For the crew, they could not be in better spirits. Such promising results proved that their endeavors were worth the while. Humanity could indeed adapt to another world, a push in the right direction.     <br>

On Pads 39A, a Jupiter-OPAV, with the fleet leading <i>Adventur</i>e mounted to the stack, sat ready to make history. Atop its great height sat a small spacecraft, seemingly silly for the size of the rocket that would be launching it, but would be the first to orbit a world that had long evaded humanity - Pluto. The Tombaugh Pluto - Charon System Explorer, or just Tombaugh, consisted of not one, but 3 spacecraft that would enable the exploration of this small and icy system. The first, and primary spacecraft, would be the Pluto Orbiter. This small spacecraft would be delivered by the nuclear electric Braking Element, powered by four RTGs, which would capture into the Pluto - Charon system and enable the chemical propulsion system of the Orbiter to take over. The third and final spacecraft would be Wanderer, a Charon flyby spacecraft that would proceed into interstellar space. This small craft, powered by batteries, would only function for a couple of months as it coasted by Charon and the other small moons of Pluto, only to be lost to the sands of time. The mission had been in the works for some time, part of NASA’s goal to explore every world, and Clyde Tombaugh himself had been part of the team planning the operations of the vehicle once it arrived. His death in 1997 would see the probe renamed to honor his legacy, and would also see his ashes orbiting the icy world, the ultimate tribute. Pluto had remained unexplored during the Grand Tour mission of the Voyager probes, and now, it had a dedicated mission headed its way. For those who worked on this mission, the launch would be the start of  a long road to discovery - with orbital insertion planned for 2015, a whole 10 years away. A sticky valve had prevented an earlier launch attempt, and the threat of bad weather loomed over the launch site, but <i>Adventure</i> would behave herself, and get the mission on its way. After separation from the core stage, and releasing the OPAV pod for her return to Earth, the Phaeton upper stage would begin its burn to send the intrepid spacecraft on its way. Its twin RL60 engines once again rattled the probe as they broke free of the Earth’s gravitational pull, moving faster and faster still. Soon, the upper stage would burn out, and a small kick motor would deliver the last push the probe needed, the first time that a Jupiter OPAV vehicle had flown with a third stage. After a short burn, the probe would separate, and unfurl its magnetometers and antennas, beginning the long voyage to the cold, distant Pluto. </span></p><br>
