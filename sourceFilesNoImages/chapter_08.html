  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">A</span><span class="calibre6">s 1985 rolled around, Rockwell had been making considerable progress on their Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle - Orbital Payload Assist Vehicle fleet, and had converted their former Shuttle production site into a 4 bay manufacturing facility. The vehicles, numbered OV-201 through 204, were in various stages of production, after a small delay in the procurement of the R-40 reaction control engine. Pathfinder tanks for the external tank modification were also proceeding on schedule, and the first flight ready tank was expected to roll off the production line by the end of 1987. Further upgrades came about in the form of upgraded “Super Light Weight” tanks which enabled even greater payload margins to the 51.6º orbit. These would become the standard Martin Marietta-provided tanks across the entire Shuttle-SDLV fleet. In light of the safety audit conducted for NASA’s orbiter fleet in the aftermath of the Utah incident, these tanks would also address potential foam shedding issues that had been noted on ascent during recent flights. It was crucial that NASA not lose an orbiter or OPAV pod to ensure maximum crew safety, as well as continue the immense forward momentum of the program. For NASA, it was a moderately comfortable time - work was progressing on all fronts of the vehicles required for Olympus, and soon, the infrastructure would be complete on Earth and in space, as the Odyssey Orbital Laboratory entered its final year of dedicated construction. All that remained of the structure would be brought up to complete complex; the starboard truss elements, logistics modules, Japanese Experiment Module and logistics carriers designed to enable greater workspace efficiency during maintenance on the MTV. At the end of the year, the station had entered its core complete phase, and became one of the largest structures ever assembled in space. Upon completion, Odyssey would see frequent rotation by Shuttle crews as the station came to life.  NASA and the Soviet Union would use this opportunity to fly together, and the first flight to the Odyssey Orbital Laboratory with a Soviet Cosmonaut, Dr. Yevgeniy Volkov, would be met with orbital fanfare similar to that of the Apollo Soyuz Test Project during his flight to Odyssey. NASA astronauts, eager to try out the venerable Soyuz vehicle, were soon offered that chance, as Star City was opened to non-Soviet astronauts to enable training on the Soyuz crew capsule for interim operations, at least until <i>Liberté </i>was certified for service.</span></p>

Work on the Mars Surface Access Vehicle, on both sides of the Pacific, was proceeding. NASDA had selected their engines for the descent stage, a licensed and modernized production run of the Soviet hydrolox RD-57 engine, rebranded under Japanese license as the LE-57M. The engine fit nearly perfectly into the program, the only snag for Japan’s industry coming from securing the production rights from the Soviet Union. Modifications to cut weight were made, including removing the RD-57’s roll control thrusters. The pathfinder engines, shipped directly from the Soviet Union, spent nearly 2,000 hours combined testing, and the subsequent LE-57M would see double that time on the stand.  The engine produced 392 kN in vacuum, and could throttle down to roughly 20%, enabling fine control during the delicate last few moments of landing. The ascent stage would see the use of the same engine, connected to a tank manufactured by Martin Marietta, as well as a unique hybrid ullage-abort system that could help bring the crew back to orbit in the event of emergency. When the vehicle would lift off the planet’s surface, 3 powerful solid rocket motors inside the aerodynamic shell of the lander would fire, pushing the vehicle away from the descent stage, and settling the propellant to be fed into the LE-57M. The whole system was designed, from the get go, to ensure that crews remained safe during their descent and ascent, and flight computers were already being tested in simulations, as well as contingency landing scenarios with astronauts. The designers of this program had touted the safety of the landing software and hardware as some of the best ever produced.<br/>

As a precursor to the Olympus program, an early expeditionary force would be required to help further the understanding of humanity on the Red Planet. A variety of probes across the Iron Curtain, and their respective rockets, were in various stages of assembly as the next window to Mars approached. It would see, for the first time, a European orbiter as well as a Japanese orbiter. This Martian Armada would be essential for laying the groundwork at their destination, and provide valuable data for the space agencies on what to expect once humans made planetfall. Most of these spacecraft were nearing completion, ready to begin humanity's trek to Mars. NASA would also perform some of the first dedicated servicing missions on their own spacecraft using the Space Shuttle system, with Atlantis approaching and grappling the stricken Solar Maximum satellite, a solar observatory which was proving useful in helping to anticipate solar storms - something that would be required in order to protect Mars bound crews. A follow up telescope, as well as a dual launch sun sensing campaign, were in the works for an early 90s launch. The launch of Hubble, NASA’s flagship space telescope, had been delayed numerous times due to cost overrun debates, as well as problems detected in the spacecraft’s mirror assembly. Many called for the cancellation of the program, but scientists supporting the program made vocal their projections for the telescope’s capability, and encouraged further development. To some, it seemed that all hands were needed for the success of Olympus, and that meant potentially axing programs that could deliver huge science return. Nevertheless, NASA and their partners persisted, calling for unity amongst scientists to approach both planetary science and astrophysics.<br/>

<i>Valiant</i> and her operations continued, seemingly without stopping for much of 1985, as work for a project known only to the public only as ODIN soldiered on in relative secrecy. Unlike NASA, which had dedicated facilities under construction for a crew in orbit, the United States Air Force had no such base of operations, which severely limited the capabilities of what the crews of <i>Valiant</i> could do. Studies pulled from the MOL program once again hinted to a greater purpose for the Air Force in space, one that looked to extend the life of their on orbit assets. A dedicated station of their own, would in theory, enable the Air Force to prolong the life of their most secret satellites, and construct new satellites with an architecture of serviceability in mind. ODIN, standing for Orbital Defense Intelligence Network, would comprise multiple components: Block II KH-11s with better Shuttle integration in mind, <i>Valiant</i> herself, and a small polar orbit space station, which would serve as the connection point. A crew could arrive at this station, capture the KH-11 they intended to service, and use either <i>Valiant’s</i> airlock or an airlock on station to go outside and service said vehicle. In contrast to NASA's Odyssey, this station would not be permanently crewed, but tended by occasional shuttle crews. The first three modules of the servicing station, a utility node, a lab and the power element, would be ordered under the guise of an Air Force research laboratory, concealing their true purpose even further.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Valiant</i> had continued to outpace NASA’s individual orbiter turnaround, flying on average once every 65.8 days. Air Force internal memos highlighted the 77th Valiant Operations Division’s streamlined servicing techniques, and made it clear that their methodology allowed them to fly as consistently as they did, unlike NASA’s finicky orbiters. NASA, comfortable in their safety conscious mindset, had continued to outpace the orbiter in terms of overall numbers of flights, but enjoyed the luxuries of a five ship fleet with detailed inspections between flights. It soon became clear, however, that the Air Force’s lax approach to safety would ultimately lead to issues. OF-16, a quick turnaround flight of the orbiter with a  classified payload, would lift off from SLC-6 in the early Fall, pitching over south into the Marine layer.  The flight would be one of the last before the upgrade to the SLWT-AF, a version of the upcoming Super Light Weight Tank designed to work directly with Aft Cargo Carriers deployed on <i>Valiant</i> missions. The vehicle would encounter fogging conditions on the flight deck windows, unusual but not unheard of for operations out of California. This lapse in vision resulted in the crew not being aware of damage to their vehicle, as a small piece of foam had come loose and fallen from the vehicle, damaging the thermal blankets and several heat shield tiles directly below the flight deck window. The crew of <i>Valiant </i>was unable to see this take place, but they did hear it, and soon after orbital insertion, it was confirmed that the nose of the orbiter had sustained damage. At the Edwards Air Force Base control center, it was clear that they had entered an unknown paradigm. NASA had encountered this issue two years earlier, with a small piece of foam striking the window pane of an orbiter, and had conducted a study detailing safe operations going forward. The Air Force, more concerned than they had seemed in a while, rushed a joint team from Rockwell and NASA to Edwards, scrambling to figure out how to assess damage to the vehicle. <i>Valiant</i> did not carry a robotic arm, but did have spacesuits available on this mission. The two payload specialists would soon be instructed in how to conduct a rather risky EVA, climbing over the flight deck while secured on a tether to the cargo bay. The damage became apparent as soon as the crewmen crossed over the flight deck, the thermal blankets had been torn, and the heat shield scuffed but not penetrated, as flight directors at Edwards had quietly feared. The crew ingressed from their EVA, and spoke with mission control about the next steps.<br/>
<br/>
OF-16 was directed by Edwards to proceed with the rest of its mission, deploying a polar orbiting Earth observation satellite, and spend an extra few days in orbit while the crew worked to assess their heat shield issues. Word of the incident had been kept locked down, and teams from Rockwell, NASA and the Air Force were instructed to keep quiet. The final two days of the mission soon dawned on the crew, and once again, they ventured out over the cabin of the orbiter. Their first step was to secure the loose thermal blanket, done with a staple gun, to the side of the orbiter. There was not much that they could do to repair the thermal protection system tiles, but photos were taken and the crew soon ingressed the airlock. After 9 days in orbit, <i>Valiant</i> would head home, with an air of anxiety surrounding both the crew and those on the ground. The vehicle entered the atmosphere, and the long lazy s-turns so customary of the shuttle program helped the ship bleed off speed as the vehicle approached the desert for its landing. High powered scopes on the ground would be the first to reveal that the damage to the orbiter was greater than anyone could have thought. <i>Valiant </i>had damaged a total of 16 tiles, a dangerous precedent for orbiter operations. NASA was quick to point the finger at unsafe practice within the Air Force, while the Air Force was quick to turn to Rockwell for answers. <i>Valiant</i> was quietly rolled into a hangar at Edwards for a conclusive review, and rumors of a potential stand down of the Air Force shuttle program spread through the 77th…<p></p>

<b>Note: </b>While it is not shown in the wonderful images done by Jay, the station would have two or three systems of robotic arms, and components to help brace the MTV when docked that can be installed to facilitate construction. Also, unlike, the ISS, these radiators will remain locked and facing nadir for ease of operations. Also, the station is in the correct orientation, with the upper PMA being reserved for the upcoming MTV. The OF-16 incident is directly inspired by the STS-27 incident, in which <i>Atlantis</i> and her crew were nearly lost due to impacts on the tiles of the vehicle.</span></p>
