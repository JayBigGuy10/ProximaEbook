  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi everyone, don't know what happened yesterday, seems as though there has been some development with our friends in the Air Force Space Office. I wanted to bring back TAV, and discuss its potential for the future of crewed space as we enter a time period where reusable flight, as we use the term today, comes into meaning. Don't worry, we will definitely be getting into TAV during next week's post, and what such a dramatic exposé does for something like military projects meant to be kept secret. For today's image annex, I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> who continues to dazzle with images of our first ship of the line, <i>Minerva</i>, in all of her free flight glory. Of note here, we can also see her OMS engines, which are derivatives of the famous and somehow eternal AJ10 engines used on Apollo, Shuttle, and in our universe, Orion!  I also wanna thank <a href="https://twitter.com/brickmack" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Mack Crawford</a> for once again allowing me to use his images of the Boeing EELV, known in the Proxima universe as Helios. Coming up, she'll see preparedness for the first crewed test flight of the program, Olympus 1, in conjunction with her Lifeboat capsule and the Shuttle. It's a really exciting time, as we've got elements of old and new space coalescing into this dramatic range of ideas and practices in a world truly poised to make history.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all, I hope you have all had a pleasant week. I am so excited to share this chapter with you, it is certainly a long one but one that I feel encapsulates the feeling that I've been attempting to convey about the excitement of going to Mars for so long. In this chapter, we'll be performing our first piloted flight of the MTV, and showcasing some of the systems that go into fueling, supplying and training for such a mission. This week, I wanna thank <a href="https://twitter.com/PZerg5" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Zarbon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a>, who have done such incredible work for this series, and without whom I could never have delivered such a complete story. They have been absolute rockstars once again!</span></p>
