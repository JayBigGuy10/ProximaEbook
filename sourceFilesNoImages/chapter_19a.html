  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all!<br>Once again, I promise that the MSAV is coming, I have quite the grand reveal planned for the coming weeks, so for all you folks who wanted to see the lander, a little patience will get you far. I wanted to take the time to highlight <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay's</a> work and show off <i>Minerva</i> on her departure, as well as discuss a little bit more about the architecture of something like a nuclear thermal powered system. One of the advantages to building a nuclear powered system is the ability to abort fairly late into your journey, by burning all of your propellant back towards Earth. This would enable the crew to board their Earth Return Lifeboat and re-enter, albeit, sacrificing the MTV.  In the Olympus Architecture, ultimately you want to reuse the core of the MTV as much as possible, and in the ideal mission architecture, the core stage parks very nicely in LEO after the whole mission is complete; ready to be refueled and refit with drop tanks. I wanted to bring this up to kind of dispel the myth that once you commit to Mars there is no way home, but it is not entirely without risk. But, returning to the story for a moment- the crew is well on their way, and I am so excited for what they have in store coming up, you all are gonna love it.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Arrival at Mars is not something I ever thought I would write about, projects like this sometimes seem so ambitious to me that I cannot fathom writing about them, and yet, here we are. Olympus 3 is falling towards the Red Planet, and our crew is ready to make history. I want to thank everyone who's supported, read, and gotten us here, it has been such a ride and we have so much to come. We have a lot of images for the image annex this week, and I really struggled to pick shots for this week because they're all so good, but I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> for doing such exceptional work and bringing us, this week, the MSAV. Yes! You read that correctly, <i>Zephyr</i> is here! We're so close to landing, we can practically already feel the crunch of the Martian soil under our boots...<br>
<br>
Additional notes: our config for shots has changed, making Mars look ever more beautiful, hope you like it! Next week will be Interlude II, with some of our most exciting stuff yet to come...</span></p>
