Noctis Labyrinth<br>
Douglass Outpost<br>
November 15, 2055</b><br>
<br>
<span class="calibre21">W</span>aking up every morning on another planet had been surreal, but I had slowly found myself getting used to it. Every day, as the sun glinted off the rocks in the canyons to our west, I would be reminded of how truly strange it was here. An isolated, barren ball of dust, littered with the remnants of robots and our first phases of exploration - not even 350 humans in the system yet, compared to the Moon’s 2,500 and rapidly growing. Mars, despite its hostility, had welcomed us in some ways. The dust storms had been relatively tame this year, resulting in us only needing to clean the exterior sensors and solar arrays every 4 days instead of 2. Our discovery of Aquifer 1C in the region late last year had boosted our water reserves, enabling a continuous presence of 70 crewmen on this station alone - a blessing in itself. Douglass Outpost, formerly Foundation, stood proudly in the center of Noctis, a gleaming mini-city on the planet’s surface. It had grown considerably since its founding all those years ago, greenhouses and lab spaces sprawled outwards from its central spire, built up in modular increments sent from Earth and more recently, indigenously constructed. This kind of production had been pioneered on the Moon, and had trickled its way down to us lowly Martians. The monotony of days inside was broken by the rumbling of the printing robots, moving across the landscape to tend to their careful constructions. I had only been here 4 months, and I could already tell that there was a real sense of pride that folks here had. The first of 5 permanent bases, and there was a real sense of pride in everything we accomplished. I had arrived onboard the <i>Kepler</i>, Europe’s third transfer vehicle off the line, assembled in the new NRHO facility with components manufactured on the lunar surface. Industry was really picking up there, and working on this dust ball seemed like a second tier position to building up a genuine city on the Moon. But Mars called, and I answered.<br>
<br>
As morning broke over the facility, I received my assignment for the day, a six hour maximum EVA to inspect a “site of geological interest,” - Aquifer 10C6. The job was simple, relatively speaking. Traverse out on foot to the work site, and get started on exploring one of the new aquifers that had been detected with the collapse of the lava tube. It was a short walk, less than two miles, something more than doable in the ARES II suits that had been brought up on the last rotation flight. They were designed to be easier on the body, lighter and made of more shock absorbing materials so we didn’t end up with scrapes and bruises on our knees and elbows every time we would kneel to pick up a rock. Relief from the aging ARES IB suits couldn’t come soon enough, and when the Chinese Tianzhou Cargo MTV arrived, we had been so eager to get our hands on suit parts that we’d forgotten the personal items. Given how familiar we were with the terrain, the buddy rule had been waived - we could proceed outwards on our own, and we were close enough to the complex that any rescue work could be done fairly quickly, one of the luxuries in being stationed here as opposed to the other facilities scattered across the planet. I proceeded out of the Lodge, what we referred to as the primary living space, and headed out through the maze of hallways and laboratories to the suit up room. In kind words, it was basically just a locker room and storage facility, filled with the comings and goings of those who stepped out onto the surface every day. Suitup was quick, we generally had the routine of getting into and out of our armored exoskeletons down pat, slipping through the suitport door into my mobile spacecraft. With a hiss, my body would be free from the structure, and I could begin my trek to the worksite, accompanied by a variety of robotic helpers. I didn’t mind the walk, for it gave me a moment to be alone with my thoughts. I put on some Steely Dan, and made it a point to enjoy my morning.<br>

As the structures of the base faded from view, I found myself once again in touch with the planet. There was a certain degree of removal that was deliberate in the design of the base, trying to give us the impression of home rather than a desolate wasteland. My comrades would complain that the redness of the soil would alter their vision, but I enjoyed all the time I could spend outside - within radiation limits of course. The muted blues and greens felt… somehow too artificial, even surrounded by the creeping plants that grew in the corridors. The desert called to me, as if it knew something I didn’t, inviting me out into its harsh embrace to learn something, to challenge my notion of this world around me. Perhaps Mars still had her secrets. After about 45 minutes of walking, I arrived at the worksite, marked on my heads up display by a glowing green arrow. There wasn’t much here, just a narrow opening in the walls of the cliff face, leading to some great unknown that I couldn’t see. Something… Something about it unsettled me. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Carefully, I knelt down and opened the cases of tools and robotic equipment that I carried, my Mule load lifter quad-bot kneeling down to act as my tool case. These robots were extensions of us, tools that broadened our reach to our environment around us. First up was the rotocraft, a small, lightweight helicopter that would act as my first scout, hoping to enter the aquifer and scout how much water could lay inside. My helmet had a small plug, which I connected to a console inside the case - my link to the eyes of the aircraft. With a swirl of dust, UAV-1 was up, and would translate forward into the narrow opening, its infrared and ultraviolet eyes scanning the environment around it. It was… Warmer in here than I expected, and I took a moment to log the temperature. Water ice sat comfortably on the ceiling, dripping down in icicles like ice caves on Earth. We had seen this before, but… Something felt different. I swiveled the camera and flipped on the powerful LED lamps, proceeding further down the tunnel. Something caught my eye, laying on the floor. <i>Wait - what is that?</i> I stood up, my heart rate increasing. An invisible hand sat wrapped around my throat, and I struggled to remember to breathe. The aircraft bucked, slamming into the wall of the cave, and disappeared from my link. Confused, I stood from my kneeling position, and took three tentative steps towards the opening. Protocol required us, if at all possible, to retrieve equipment - but every ancient instinct in my body said to not go in there. Something was wrong, fundamentally wrong with the way this was playing out. I stood there for a few moments, pondering the nature of what I was about to do, logged my position, and prepared to enter the narrow passageway.<br>
<br>
It was just wide enough for my suit, the broad armored shoulders scraping against the weathered sandstone. Dust hung in the air, clinging to my suit’s visor with its electrostatic grip. I brushed it off as I ventured further down the passageway, feeling the corridor constrict all around me. Minutes felt like hours as I proceeded further, and I struggled to keep my cool - despite training as an astronaut, I really hated tight spaces. An alarm sprung up on my suit, not an internal problem, but… A trace gas warning? Something was different about the environment here, oxygen, carbon and methane levels were higher here. This was entirely not normal - nothing had the ability to generate gasses in this volume. Nothing that we knew of. My gaze remained so locked on the screens on my wrist that I nearly lost my footing as I encountered UAV-1, laying twisted on its side in the chamber, lights still flickering weakly. I felt… Frightened. For the first time in so long, I felt so deeply afraid, paralyzed by a fear of the unknown that I had not felt in so long. Like a child facing a nightmare. Slowly, I cast my headlamps across the chamber, puddles of water sitting on the floor. Liquid water… Liquid water this close to the surface had never been observed like this before. <i>It was impossible… Wasn’t it?</i> I stepped closer, my reflection distorted behind the suit and in the hazy, dusty void of the cavern. Movement. My proximity alarm tripped, a small ping on the right side of my helmet. <i>What the fuck? Where- </i>I lost my balance, my suit rocking forward and landing me firmly in the puddle. Mud coated my faceplate, and I struggled to right myself. I was blind, cold, and alone - deep underground somewhere. For a moment, I remained still, imagining the sounds of the cave. A wet, cold drip, something… present. Something new. <b><i>Warning, high heart rate - rest as needed.</i></b> The biometric alarms would no doubt be triggering back at the base, if they could hear me at all, and I managed to get myself onto my feet. That’s when I saw it. A hexagonal structure, seeming to ebb and flow with the movement of the universe around it - I felt it watching me. I stood, moving slowly so as not to startle it… It was clear that whatever it was, it startled easily, and fried the UAV. It seemed to stare back at me, no longer threatened. It seemed to only observe, watching slowly with its non-existent eyes. The rigid hexagonal towers that rose from it seemed so artificial, and yet, reminded me of the great steps of the Giant’s Causeway on Earth. So familiar and yet so different. I found myself speechless, my chest tight with something, not fear but… Wonder. And then it hit me - I was the only one who knew. The only one who knew that this thing existed. The only human, across any part of settled space, that knew that something was fundamentally different. That we were not alone. My heartrate started to creep up again, and I shakily held up my hand. The… Thing - it moved. It raised a column of green and gray in response. It understood me… What I was, perhaps not, but there was a degree of understanding present. <i>My god, we were not alone after all. </i><br>
<br>
I had to run, for there was no turning back. I documented what I could, wiping the mud from my helmet cams, and turned towards the opening, eager to see the light of day again. The walls of the cave seemed tighter, and I struggled against the restriction of the chasm as I made my way out. All I could think of was getting out. On my hands and knees, I crawled up the sloping dunes and found myself where I had been before the world had changed, a moment of rebirth into the harsh desert of the planet. Terra Nova. I craned my neck as I struggled to stand, looking for the lights of the base in the distance. I had to run. My heart felt as though it was straining to keep up, and I started to run, leaving my equipment behind. Now, out of the cave, communications were restored and I could hear the chatter of the human race once more, so blissfully unaware that change was coming. I stumbled in the shifting sand, sweat stinging my eyes. There was no going back. No way to move beyond this. I had to run - the sole bearer of information that would alter humanity forever. If there was a God, perhaps he would be kind to our species, and set us on the right path. My bones, weakened by the lack of gravity, would ache as I continued my trek, but I didn’t care. My lungs and heart screamed at me, and the tunnel vision of exhaustion crept into my field of view, suffocating me like the cave had. Voice after voice filled my ears as I got closer to the base, asking me why I had slipped from view, why my suit was stained red with the iron rich mud of the planet. I didn’t care, my world and my ideas of normality slipped from me. I had to tell someone, and soon. The doors of the base, sealed against the harsh elements of the planet, were all that stood in between me and the rest of humanity, but I was determined to go through them. For there was no way back. Only forward, onto a horizon heretofore unseen. <i>God help us all - for the dawn of some new era was upon us.</i> With as much force as I could muster, I began to pound on the door. </span></p>
