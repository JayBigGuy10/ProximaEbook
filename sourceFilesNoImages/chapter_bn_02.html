“This is CNN Breaking News out of Houston... We are going to suspend our normal format for the evening, and bring to you a special bulletin regarding an ongoing situation here at the historic Johnson Space Center. NASA and the rest of the Olympus Partners in Cologne and Moscow have announced that an accident has occurred onboard Mars Transfer Vehicle <i>Hera</i>, en route to the Red Planet as part of the Olympus 9 mission. Contact has been lost with the team onboard, and crews are working to restore communication with the spacecraft if at all possible. The crew of the spacecraft is an international consortium, consisting of Russian Sergei Ivanov, American Maxwell Knowles, Frenchman Dr. Nicolas Delon, Japan’s Suzu Ayase, NASA’s Christopher Taylor, the UK’s Freya Robinson, Australia’s Timothy Small and Canada’s Elliot Weir. They were due to spend over 400 days on the Martian surface, investigating the surface in an effort to study the planet. Just before their loss of contact, they had been conducting repairs on the outside of the vessel, when the status of a crew member who has not been named at this time became unstable. The teams here at Mission Control then received numerous warning messages on their consoles, the computers they use to interact with the team in space, indicating there were several key problems onboard. We do not know their condition, but hopefully, there is a plan in place to ensure their safety. As of now, NASA has not released any further information, but has promised to let us know when they have more to share. Now, we turn our thoughts to the crew... Their status, and that of the ship, remains unknown. All we know, as of right now, is that the crew of Olympus 9… if they are on a safe abort trajectory, are most likely not going to make it to a Martian landing. Only time will tell now if they are headed home. Stick with us folks, more coverage is still to come…” </span> </span></p>
