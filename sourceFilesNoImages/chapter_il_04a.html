  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi everyone, I cannot wait to showcase for you what I have in store this week, this is something I had honestly not planned to write about, but so much inspiration came to me at once, that I could not help but get it down and make this a part of our story. I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/4possumsinacoat" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Peter</a> this week for all his help in designing not only some of the mechanisms in the story, but helping with the choreography as a whole. Now, without further adieu, let's jump right in to Chapter 41!</span></p>
