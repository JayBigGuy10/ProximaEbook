  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi everyone, I really don't have too much to say today other than giving a huge shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> for the images he gave us last week, and how excited and grateful I am for his continued support of Proxima. Next week, as I said in the prelude to Chapter 24, we've got some familiar and new faces supporting the project who I'm super grateful for and I can't wait to showcase what they've got. Now, this week I've got something really special for you, the absolute majesty of Venus in all of its glory. While missions to Venus in real life may seem kind of off the table for now, they've long been discussed when thinking about the next steps of human exploration, as far back as the Apollo program. The Apollo Venus flyby mission was one such proposal, using a wet workshop S-IVB to support 3 astronauts on this journey. In Proxima, the utilization of NTR enables us to do much more, and have the MTV (or in this case, VTV) act as a scientific platform for the deployment and observation of spacecraft in orbit of another world.</span></p>

  <i>Completing the final few seconds of the burn, Hera prepares to settle into a comfortable low orbit around the planet, ready to begin a 30 day observation campaign.

  <i>Her maneuvers over, Hera can re-orient herself with the cupola facing the planet, revealing... not a whole lot. The variety of sub-probes deployed from the ship would provide more data than just the eyes of the crew.</i>

  <i>Hera would also use her own instruments to analyze the planet, including a radar suite and magnetometer cluster. These readings would help to determine the physical composition of the planet, and look for any active geological processes.</i>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all!, I'm so very excited to showcase what we have in store this week, which will be an exploration of a space program we haven't really touched on yet - China. Writing about the Chinese space program is often difficult because so much of the engineering and history is not readily accessible, but I will do the best I can with what information I can find. We're also gonna be trying out some footnote stuff, which might help folks understand what's happening a little better. I wanna thank 3 wonderful people this week who've helped me get some beautiful images your way: <a href="https://twitter.com/LM__Steve" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Steven</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/salyutseven" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ben</a>, who have given us a view into the universe of Proxima as a whole. Please make sure to check out their other work!</span></p>
