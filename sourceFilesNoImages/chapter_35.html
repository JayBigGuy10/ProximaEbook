			“3… 2… 1… And liftoff from sunny Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, of the Delta III rocket with NOAA and the Weather Channel’s StormWatch 1, providing increased accuracy for weather monitoring across the continental United States and beyond! We have cleared the tower… Pitch and roll program execution… That’s right, an exceptional launch to behold today! A little bit about today’s launch, StormWatch 1 will be headed into a unique orbit called a Molniya, which will enable us to hover over the United states, enabling full coverage as we grow- standby… [<b>Okay everybody stay at your stations…</b>] As you can see, we’ve had a massive anomaly, standing by to hear what’s happened here… stay tuned folks…”

<span class="calibre21">O</span>n March 11, 2011 In the skies of Cape Canaveral, the debris of a private weather satellite and a Delta III rocket rained down on the Atlantic, bringing to a swift end a mission designed to revolutionize and bolster access to information about weather over the the United States. In the immediate days after the disaster, pieces of equipment would be pulled from the water - and in a PR crisis for the launch provider, Boeing, the fairing would be pulled from the icy Atlantic, containing the inscription of StormWatch 1, and Boeing. One of the first major space accidents in well over 10 years, the media would descend on the Cape, with Boeing in the firing line. Almost immediately, Boeing would offer their medium to heavy lift Helios vehicle to the Weather Channel, with a reduced but still high price to launch StormWatch 1A, the backup satellite. Ultimately, Lockheed would snag the contract out from under them, securing a much more competitive rate. It would soon become clear that commercial support for Delta III was waning - the vehicle was aging, and many felt as though the quality of products that had been shipped had not been up to snuff. Lockheed would quickly move to secure payloads that were set to launch on Delta III, and even dual launching payloads that had been meant for Delta II. For the team at Boeing, the situation looked rather dire. Helios had been a long standing success, and had payloads to keep it flying for many years, but their medium lifters looked to be aging too quickly to keep up with market demand. Confidence was waning fast, and a stand down attempt at a second launch later that year resulted in yet another payload being gobbled up by Atlas. An investigation revealed Boeing’s worst fears, the failure had been due to a liquid oxygen pump failing, and the explosion igniting the fuel in the tanks, effectively causing the rocket to unzip. The RS-27 main engine was also in use on the Delta II, the sister launch vehicle. Delta III was quietly retired without grace, the last flight model donated to the Rocket Garden at Kennedy Space Center, while Delta II soldiered on for a few more flights. Boeing was in crisis, losing a light to medium launch vehicle meant that they had relied on for so many years. Unsure of their steps, the teams at Boeing returned to the drawing board, and began to piece together their next move.<br>

Despite this failure, the progress of the exploration of the Solar System continued. Cassini had just been extended, and was well on its way to operate to the late 2010s or even beyond. The relative success of Huygens had bolstered plans for landings in the Outer Solar System. An early proposal that had been circulating highlighted the need for a detailed series of landers on the surface of Titan to learn about the complex geology and chemistry taking place on the moon. A follow-on dedicated orbiter to Cassini, Titan Life Explorer, was proposed by the Applied Physics Laboratory to be launched on a fast transfer to the moon in order to study the various systems that the veiled moon possessed, and ponder over whether or not the moon contained life. This, however, would have to wait, as Jupiter once again came into focus. Two rockets sat on their respective pads at Kennedy Space Center. On Pad 39A, a Jupiter-OPAV, with the fully assembled Borelli orbiter, a behemoth of a spacecraft ready to explore the Jupiter system. Borelli had been in part, a scaled back version of the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, or JIMO concept, proposed in years prior. An immensely complex launch campaign would have been required But Borelli was not alone. Further down the range, a Boeing Helios vehicle, with its 7m Phaeton upper stage, sat ready to rendezvous with the probe in orbit, one of the first times such a feat had been attempted. The probe itself was massive, and would not be able to make it to Jupiter on its own despite its Nuclear Electric Propulsion Element. Instead, it would rendezvous with the payload-less Phaeton upper of Helios, before committing to Trans-Jupiter-Injection. The whole operation would take less than 48 hours, arguably one of the most important parts of the mission. Such a quick turnaround was necessitated by the batteries onboard Borelli, the vehicle could only remain in its quiescent mode for that long. If this objective was not met, Gateway would be dispatched to retrieve the vehicle, a complex process that would add costly delays to the project as a whole. Fortunately, this retrieval would not be necessary, a picture perfect launch by <i>Inspiration</i> would carry the probe to orbit, followed 6 hours later by the Helios-Phaeton stack. The probe would rely on long duration batteries as it patiently awaited its ride to the outer Solar System, but tensions remained high in JPL as mission planners waiting for the Phaeton stage to make its final move. Docking would be conducted smoothly, under the gentle puffs of Phaeton’s reaction control thrusters, and the two giant spacecraft would become one. Soon, the twin engines of Phaeton would light, pushing Borelli out of the Earth-Moon system. The powerful upper stage would shut down, and the vehicle would be released, unfurling its massive boom and extending its radiators, ready to explore the Jovian system<br>

At Mars, the crew of Olympus 11 would arrive on the surface to a conundrum - Argonaut was nowhere to be found. Before their descent, they had observed as Argonaut had attempted to traverse the final 20 miles to the landing site, navigating a treacherous field of sand. The rover had clearly gotten stuck, and was commanded to hunker down and wait for the crew to arrive. Upon their landing, Jennifer Van Zandt, the commander, would head out on their lightweight rover to the last reported position accompanied by Ben Hampton and Vadin Surdyuk, only to find the rover in a sorry state. The pressurized rover was caught in a sandtrap, six inches deep on the first two wheels with no easy way out of the pit. Hampton would get to work with the shovel, while Surdyuk would come up with something rather ingenious. Using the science airlock, he would toss two sleeping mats from the spare equipment locker onto the sand, and work with the Commander to try and move the front wheels onto them. Over the course of many hours, the crew would carefully inch the rover out of the sand trap, before the rover would finally come to rest on the planet’s surface once again. Triumphantly, they would return to their lander, <i>Hercules</i>, in a display of strength. The scene would be broadcast around the world, two astronauts riding on the sides of the lander (in a definite violation of safety regulation) waving the flags of their mission. They had done it, rescued a vital piece of equipment that would enable them to explore the surface of Mars. And explore the surface they did. Their first three week expedition would take them to the edge of Gale Crater, a large feature on the planet’s surface. The crater had been a prime target for exploration in the early days of the Olympus program, but had been ruled out in favor of flatter areas until the landing characteristics of the MSAV had been better understood. The crew of Dubrov, Anmundsen and Graves would make their way to the crater’s rim, before anchoring the rover to the ground and preparing to repel down the side. A unique feature of the ARES suits flown on this mission were integrated harness points for repelling, something the early crews did not have to contend with. The rover would winch them down around 90 feet to an outcropping, where they could retrieve samples from the cliff side and work in relative comfort. Within 30 minutes, they had made a profound discovery - more water ice. This water, however, was special - it was mostly solid, protected from the ablative impacts and the sun by the side of the cliff, and contained bubbles and little dirt, a unique find in comparison to the contaminated crystals observed on Olympus 8. The crew were overjoyed, another discovery that could potentially offer clues to the past of the Red Planet. Ever so carefully, the water was extracted in small, stainless steel cores and placed in a sealed container, kept cool by siphoning power from their suits. It was a delicate operation, and the crew had to be in perfect sync in order to ensure the preservation of the delicate samples. The return from Gale Crater would be long, but Argonaut did her job, carrying the crew home to finish the rest of their work on the surface. The rover, despite its hiccup during the transit, had been an immensely useful asset, and as the odometer ticked up, mission planners began to work on the next bold leap for the Martian surface crews.</span></p>

In Korou, French Guiana, a new age was beginning. Clad in their flight suits, a crew of two boarded their transfer van and made the 3 mile drive to the launch pad. They were to be Europe’s first independently launched astronauts, riding their Liberté CFV <i>Promise</i> to the waiting Athena complex. The mission commander, Lara Nespoli, had flown twice to <i>Zarya</i> and had been a mission specialist on Olympus 1, a seasoned veteran who ESA had not hesitated to assign. The mission’s pilot would be Maxime Martel, another Olympus veteran who had flown on the unusual 5V mission to Venus. Where a normal mission would seat 4 or even 6, this mission would be the smallest crew flight of Liberté. Athena had entered a decrewed period, which was to be avoided in the future as rotations from both Soyuz and Liberté would ensure a constant crewed presence onboard the outpost. This was largely done to ensure a safe operating environment for the still experimental vehicle. Below the station, steaming in the sticky Korou heat sat their carrier rocket, the newly christened EuroZenit. Instead of the gray paint scheme flown on Energia, this variant was adorned with the flags of all the European Space Agency member states against a white and blue background, sprinkled with gold stars. In many ways, it was emblematic of the program itself - at long last, after nearly 30 years of spaceflight by way of other programs, Europe could speak for itself in space. As the hatch closed, and the service structures swung away from the rocket, the whole continent would turn their attention to the small colony of France. The final moments of the countdown came and went, and the RD-170 main engine of the vehicle would roar to life, scattering the various frigate birds and other wildlife around the complex. The vehicle would lift off of the pad, and Nespoli could be heard over the big loop proclaiming “Che Giro!” - <i>What a ride</i>. The vehicle would pitch over and align itself with the correct heading, the power of the main engine audible as it crackled over the Amazon rainforest. In orbit, the Russo-European crew would use their high power cameras to capture the launch, the dawn of a new era in space. Soon, the first stage would be expended and separate, falling away towards the cold Atlantic ocean. Under the thrust of the second stage, the crew would continue to orbit, before the engines of the second stage would shut down, and silence would fall over the spacecraft, peace in orbit at last.<br>
<br>
Across the continent, the mood was jubilant - Europe had become the fourth player in space, a dream held so dearly for so long by so many. The spacecraft, as it crossed the Atlantic, would assume the correct attitude for orbital cruise, its crew taking the first pictures of a united Europe staring up at them. In Korou, Arianespace executives opened a bottle of champagne as they watched the trail of smoke from the rocket dissipate. In Paris, a light show projected on the Eiffel Tower showcased an animation of the rocket carrying the strange looking spaceplane to orbit. In Turin, bells rang in the city center, and in London, the great London Eye was illuminated with the flags of ESA member states. As the spacecraft separated from its upper stage, the crew would begin to configure <i>Promise</i> for her two day orbital flight. Solar panel deployment had been one of the first events post separation, with the angled solar array wings elegantly unfurling from the sides of the orbital module and locking into place. One of the first tasks accomplished by the crew would be to open the hatch between the entry module and the orbital module, accomplished by sliding two doors out of the way. This would reveal to the crew the docking control systems, additional life support and plenty of room for two. The next two days would be spent giving press conferences, observing the Earth below, and beginning their approach to Athena. One key test still remained for the intrepid spacecraft, docking. While the vehicle could dock automatically, it was decided that a test of manual approach would push the spacecraft in ways it would not normally. After their two day chase, <i>Promise</i> would line up with the forward port, extending the soft docking ring on the orbital module’s APAS collar. Martel would take the stick, inching ever closer to their target. The crew of the strange spacecraft could only observe as their new station grew ever closer, this futuristic yet somehow familiar spacecraft hanging ever so silently just meters away from them. Soon, with a gentle thump, the two spacecraft would connect, and the hatches would swing open. The crew of <i>Promise</i> would celebrate, and Europe would turn their eyes to the future, ready for whatever lay waiting for them.</span></p>

American satellites swiveled their electronic eyes to look at the Wenchang launch facility in southern China, alerted to some form of launch. As they trained their sensors, they would detect something big and previously unknown, rocketing skywards. Across the country, and around the world, intelligence agencies perked up, stirred from the melancholy nature of image processing. Sleepy sentinels, one by one, turned their infrared eyes on the vehicle, rocketing towards this new super heavy vehicle. As the boosters fell away, and the payload fairings would jettison, observers on the ground and suspended in space would do what they could to identify the mysterious spacecraft. As the core stage burned out, barely orbital, it became clear to spotters on the ground what had been launched - a space station core. Such a thing was not outside of the realm of possibility, their ambitions for such a facility had been made known - but the Chinese had been unusually public in their space endeavors, and very little chatter circulated around the internet. NROL-68, a KH-11 KENNEN, was soon assigned the task of imaging the spacecraft on-orbit in order to learn more, and after a few weeks of phasing, completed its pass. It revealed a spacecraft much like the DOS modules found on <i>Zarya</i>, albeit with much newer construction. New, roll-out solar arrays and other upgrades could be made out, but what was most shocking was the aft of the spacecraft - a truss segment, or the start of one. The station would sit, untouched in orbit for many weeks before yet another new heavy lift vehicle would lift off, casting off its boosters and fairing all the same. Once again, the eyes of the world turned to see what great payload it carried. As the core stage drifted away, the payload would begin to unfold itself. From the sides of the spindly vehicle, two great arrays would stretch out, and after successful docking to the space station core, it became clear what their purpose was: an ion drive. </span></p>
