  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all!,<br>
<br>
I hope you all enjoyed this week's chapter, and enjoy this week's images from <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/thatleggydog" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Trystan</a>! We've covered a lot this week, so I wanna give you some great images of our equipment in service, really detailing how amazing this architecture is. Jay and Trystan are amazing contributors, so you should all show them some love if you get the chance! Next week, we'll have our second interlude, which is something I've been looking forward to for a long time, and I cannot wait to share it with you. After this, we'll definitely see the pace of things picking up, as our plans accelerate. I'm really excited that we've gotten here, boots on Mars is so so close and I can't imagine what our crew members are feeling. How would you feel, as a crew member on Olympus 3? Would you be excited, scared, nervous etc? Please let me know your thoughts, would love to hear them!</span></p>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">I don't have a whole lot to say, other than so much has been leading to this. The pace of the world will only pick up after this post, and will only get more exciting for us. This is one of the things I've been so proud of, and also so nervous to share, but I'm being brave and sharing it.  <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> is gonna have an amazing image annex for us and I'm very excited to share this part with you. Thank you again for everyone who's gotten us here, and thank you for everyone who's supporting what's coming. I hope you all enjoy.</span></p>
