  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Good afternoon everyone!, I've had a little bit of a crazy week, so I'm happy I could sit down and get some stuff out to you. This week, we're taking a look at the operations of Olympus 8 as they perform the second long duration stay on the planet, courtesy of our good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a>, and some new probe action from a new contributor, <a href="https://twitter.com/ValsAerospace" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Valerie</a>! Valerie has been making some kick-ass probes recently, and I'm so excited to get to feature her work with Tombaugh! Let's get the ball rolling!</span></p>

  <i>Nearly there, the crew of Olympus 8 prepares their ship for their arrival burn - practiced many times by crews and infrastructure before them, but arduous none the less. All that stands between them and Mars orbit is ignition of the Valkyrie engines.</i>

  <i>Her engines lit, Prometheus works to slow the ship down for arrival at Mars, pushing the crew into their seats.</i>

  <i>With successful drop tank separation, they're nearly there, in the home stretch of the push towards humanity's second long stay on the Red Planet.

  <i>Unfurling her instruments, Tombaugh sets sail for Pluto, one of the most complicated outer planets probes ever assembled. Her multiple stages would enable capture around Pluto 10 years from now.</i>

  <i>Tombaugh and Wanderer turn to look back at Earth a final time - for soon she will be out of view forever. Mission controllers would be eager to test the probe's camera functions with a calibration shot at Earth, before the long sleep...</i>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Good morning everyone!, I hope you are all having a great day, and have been looking forward to today's installation. Can you believe it's been 30 whole chapters? I certainly can't, and I must say, I'm very proud of my resolve in working through this project, and I absolutely could not have done this without the amazing folks doing all the different media which helps bring the universe to life. Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> has been kind enough to provide us with images, and I'm as always super blown away. Next week will be our third interlude before we continue onwards with our story... very exciting stuff ahead!</span></p>
