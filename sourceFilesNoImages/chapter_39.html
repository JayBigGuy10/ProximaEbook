  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">A</span><span class="calibre6">t LC-39A, Commander Douglass gazed up through the windows of <i>Endeavour</i>, sunlight gently filtering in across the old orbiter’s displays. Her launch and entry suit pressed against her shoulders and hips, reminding her of where she was, filling her brain with the memories of being on the flight deck of an orbiter - bound for worlds unknown. It was her first time not flying on <i>Intrepid</i>, somehow bringing a sense of discomfort and unfamiliarity with it. In the cargo bay sat their lifeboat, Liberté <i>Hope</i>, as well as provisions for their six month mission to Horizon. Considerable work had been done in orbit to prepare the station for habitation, the forward and aft node modules had been installed, and the initial “Power Tower” truss had been delivered by a Jupiter OPAV just weeks before their projected launch. Gateway had also delivered the two modules it had stored onboard to the station, ready for activation by the first permanent crew. Anna had watched each launch closely as they brought component after component to the station, a steady flow of vehicles from across the world. Now, here she sat, commander of Horizon Expedition 1, ready to once again take the lead. Technicians were loading the rest of the crew members into the vehicle, working carefully to ensure that everyone was right where they needed to be. Anna closed her eyes, thinking about her first voyage aboard Olympus 1, and the fear and excitement she felt - this almost felt too routine. Those first few hours had felt so unnerving yet… so freeing. Free at last from the confines from Earth. Further and further into this dream world she drifted, falling away from the flight deck and into orbit once more. A hand touched her shoulder, and she opened her eyes once more - brought back to reality. Christopher Taylor lay in the seat next to her, smiling at her through his visor. She reached for him, placing her hand on his shoulder as he had touched hers. “I’m happy you’re here, Chris. When I called you I wasn’t sure you’d pick up, let alone want to try again… So, so happy.” Taylor chuckled, shifting to get comfortable in his seat, “You were very convincing, Commander, besides, it's an honor to fly with a legend like you!” She rolled her eyes, laughing quietly. “If by that you mean to call me old, I might rethink that phone call! I’m only a few years older than you, last I checked.” They both chuckled, isolated for a moment from the noise of the cabin, at last growing excited about the mission ahead. As the day wound on, the rest of their six crew members would be helped into the orbiter, chuckling and chattering about their work to come on the station. Anna would let her worries that clouded her mind leave her once again, ready to take command and let the adventure begin.<br>
<br>
Launch had proceeded on schedule, soaring into the Florida twilight for a two day chase. <i>Endeavour</i>, as soon as she was in orbit, would open her payload bay doors, allowing the crew to give <i>Hope</i> a once over, as well as their pallet of cargo. Everything had survived the trip into orbit, and they could continue their chase to their new home - looming somewhere over their heads. Taylor was the first to spot it, with a resonating “Tally Ho!” from the flight deck windows. The crew would all gather, pressing their faces to the glass to spot it, the latest and greatest in space station technology. She was… Big, very very big. Her 8.4 meter core dwarfed the modules carried up by shuttle, and her solar arrays seemed to carry her like great wings. Much work was still to be done on the scientific equipment on the truss that was planned for her. As the day passed, the orbiter grew ever closer, stalking their new home in orbit with great care. The electronic eyes of the station would train themselves on the shuttle, and soon, the two would meet, a delicate embrace of petals and robotic manipulator systems. The crew would file in to inspect their new home, this gargantuan complex in orbit. Anna would be first, passing through the forward node and into the massive Core module. It was enormous, bigger than any structure in Low Earth Orbit,  longer than the Habitats onboard the MTVs. She marveled at it, and turned to face her crew, following suit to perform flips in this gargantuan space. She smiled, and as the crew settled in, she contemplated her next move. <i>Endeavour</i> had remained on station for about a week, installing their lifeboat before casting off to return home to Florida. Their first few weeks were largely occupied with checkout and setup, as well as some life sciences experiments. The crew were adjusting well to their expansive new home in orbit, and she was functioning beautifully - a testament to the ruggedness of her design. Anna spent her time staring not only out the window, but watching her crew, watching what was once a dream for her play out in real time. Human beings… living and working in space, something so incredibly routine. But more importantly, she watched Taylor as he smiled and worked his way through the new spacecraft, overjoyed with the feeling of floating free once more. She tried not to let out a tear, and began work on writing her remarks on the first month of station operations.</span></p>

Olympus 13’s arrival at the Red Planet, as routine as these missions had seemingly become, was full of surprises. The wisps of dust that covered the planet, projected for their arrival, had given away to sweeping views of the planet from orbit. The crew first spotted Phlegra Montes after their arrival at the base station, as they were preparing their lander, <i>Aquila</i>, for descent. They remarked at its strange shape, and began move their cargo from the Base Station and MTV onto their vehicle. Three weeks after their arrival at the Red Planet, they would be falling through its atmosphere, their 5 LE-57M main engines powering them through a successful descent, bringing them within 200 feet of their expected landing site, cargo landers visible on the horizon - with their rover waiting. Their first steps on the surface, on a quest to retrieve their cargo, would have their mission’s lander pilot, Sergei Nikolaev remark: “Our friend Aldrin was perhaps onto something, it is indeed such magnificent desolation. Worth the journey, for sure.” The first week of their surface stay was preoccupied with the establishment of their base camp, prepping Aquila for her role as a habitat on the Martian surface. The work pioneered by Olympus 7 had made this process a relatively straightforward one - the collection of the cargo modules had been made even easier with the addition of their veteran rover, Argonaut. Her odometer was racking up the miles quite quickly, and there were some concerns about not being able to dispatch the rover to the next, and final landing site planned prior to base operations. As intrepid as Argonaut had been, controllers began to consider the possibility of the vehicle powering down permanently once the 13 crew had headed home. The first long sortie would see the crew voyage to one of the “veins” of Phlegra Montes, as the crew had described them. These long, fingerlike mountains were unlike nearly anything else found on the surface of the planet. As the first crew of brave explorers approached, they had not realized what they had exactly stumbled upon. As they prepared to cross the last several miles, their hazard analysis systems would light up. Before them, a field of great openings in the surface of the planet - lava tubes, carved long ago by the violent volcanoes that ruled the planet. The approach to the veins was immediately called off, and the crew would start deploying equipment - including a new type of exploration tool, an aircraft. This new aircraft, a twin bladed helicopter named <i>Curiosity</i>, would take off from the top deck of Argonaut and proceed forward, scanning the surrounding terrain, before hovering over the entrance to one of the tubes. Very carefully, the crew would instruct the helicopter to descend into the chasm, and power on its “headlamp”, a small LED lamp that would enable the crew onboard a decent view of the surroundings. As the probe descended, the crew would make note of the dust and debris visible on the floor of the tube. As they prepared to translate the helicopter forward, a problem would emerge. A failure on one of the motors would force the helicopter down, tumbling in the Martian gravity towards an uncertain fate, components probably strewn across the floor of the tube. The crew were obviously disappointed, and soon turned their attention towards the journey to Phlegra Montes, mourning the loss of their intrepid helicopter. As they drove away, their minds could not help but wander, and start to speculate as to what caused the failure? <br>

As work on the Martian surface progressed, and probes and stations soared over the surface, two new vehicles had begun to take shape. The first was the Advanced Crew Exploration Vehicle, who’s design had been finalized and construction work could soon begin. Lockheed and Airbus had been victorious in winning the contract, and ensured international cooperation would continue, and Lockheed would reign as a chief supplier of spaceflight components. Lockheed would take over construction of the Command Module from the Airbus consortium that was building the lifeboats. The Command Module was largely identical to the lifeboat, albeit with a few tweaks, such as the addition of a storm shelter and a redesigned flight deck. A new feature added was the “Modular Seating System,” a cabin arrangement that could be reshuffled to allow for different crew sizes to use the space, with a maximum capacity of up to 8 for station missions or fewer for longer duration, independent operation. With Lockheed working on the Command Module, Airbus would turn their attention to the service module, leveraging work from both the Liberté and ATV programs. There would be 2 types of service module produced, a LEO-Station version which would ferry crew to and from the myriad of stations in orbit, and a BLEO version which would act as a support vehicle and lifeboat. Both vehicles would be integrated at Kennedy Space Center, and launched onboard Atlas NG vehicles to either rendezvous with a space station or dock with a vehicle headed to another deep space destination. The first production tooling for the new ACEV Command Modules would be shipped to the US for setup in the fall of 2015, with the aim of completing the assembly line by the spring of the next year. In Japan, much of the propulsion work for Phoenix Test Vehicle 1 was entering the preliminary build phase. The design had been finalized alongside work for ACEV, common hardware from the crew vehicle would be carried over, and the first pressure vessels were being welded for their test campaigns. New contractors, such as Raytheon, IBM and smaller startups were brought in to facilitate the myriad of technologies required to ensure Phoenix could get its crew to the surface every time. Construction plans then turned to production rate, only 3 vehicles were planned to be built, with only one in service at a time, up to two as Foundation expanded. The third vehicle would be kept on the ground as a spare if an issue would present itself during its operational life. One of the key issues facing production was the sheer volume of thermal protection system required to protect the vehicle during entry descent and landing - and the thermal stress of loitering in space for extended periods of time. Ultimately, work leveraged for the evolved Centaur program would lend a hand in thermal management, and work could proceed on the bodywork for the new class of lander.<br>

In the distant outer fringes of the Solar System, a spacecraft was transforming. Launched nearly a decade ago, the Tombaugh Pluto-Charon System Explorer was bearing down on its final destination, the icy clump of worlds on the edge of known space. For scientists on the team, this was years in the making, and one of the most complicated maneuvers of the entire mission - Pluto Orbit Insertion. Before the nuclear electric stage could power on to perform this maneuver, the probe’s passenger had to be released - an intrepid traveler who would make the trek to the outer fringes of known space, not explored since the days of Voyager and Pioneer. The spacecraft would pitch, and execute a command stored for nearly 10 years, the release of the Wanderer interstellar probe. The cameras onboard would capture the moment of Wanderer’s separation, a quick shot for posterity, knowing that the eyes of humans or robots would never look upon this spacecraft ever again. As it drifted away, work would soon resume on preparing Tombaugh for its maneuver into orbit. The first step would be a small course correction, done with the reaction control system, before the automated orbital insertion maneuver would be conducted. This would be one of the most arduous points of the whole mission, swinging by Pluto as the spacecraft slowed itself from nearly 10 years of travel through the Solar System. To make matters more complicated, the antenna would have to be pointing away from the Earth as the spacecraft conducted the hours long burn to enter orbit, meaning that data regarding the health of the vehicle could not be transmitted until the maneuver was completed. As the hours passed in JPL’s Mission Control Center, the engineers and scientists, as well as Clyde Tombaugh’s own daughter could merely sit and wait. The spacecraft, they trusted, was doing what it had been taught to do all those years ago - working to the best of its ability. The time for check in loomed closer and closer, and the room was stale with worry. The silence was broken by the head of Guidance, who shouted with glee: “We have a tone! Good orbit!” The room would erupt into celebration, a cacophonous reminder of the power of the human spirit. Soon, a flood of health data would follow, streaming into the center from the empty void of space. The scientific community would rejoice, celebrating NASA’s successful orbit of a most distant world. The next day would bring the real surprise, one of the clearest images ever taken of the dwarf planet, showcasing exotic reds and browns, and a silver heart adorning its surface. Humanity looked upon a world unseen, a world so fragile - a world so unlike their own, that many could not believe their eyes. Tombaugh’s daughter, Annette, would remark that the heart shaped feature on the surface reminded her of her father - Tombaugh’s Heart.</span></p>

If the Olympus partners were full steam ahead, China was in overdrive. In the past year alone, they had made monumental progress, learning from the success of the Olympus program, and constructing their own Gateway-alike station complex, Tianyu, to support a continuous Shenzhou crew working and living in space. In Wenchang, launch preparations were underway, for a most crucial phase for the Chinese space agency had begun - the refit of their great spacecraft into one that could support a mission to a most distant, mysterious world. An asteroid, discovered not 20 years before, had been chosen as the primary target for a mission that would cement China as even more of a power than ever before. Tianyu had moved to dock with Baochuán as it returned to LEO from its harrowing ordeal in the Van Allen belts, components damaged and systems failing left and right. But the repair crews had a job to do, for there was another crew they were supporting. On the ground, the final phase of a clandestine mission’s training was wrapping up.  The crew had run their training for months now, unbeknownst to the rest of the world, simulating the 2 month outbound cruise, month of activities, and two month cruise back from Near Earth Object 2003 TK9, planned for the coming year. Despite the shortcomings of their previous mission, the pace had been fast to ensure that they were ready for their window, when their great spacecraft could once again leave Earth orbit and head out into the unknown. Launch after launch would tend to the spacecraft in orbit, wounded from its previous trip outside of Low Earth Orbit, like some kind of great beast ready to begin the hunt once again. </span></p>
