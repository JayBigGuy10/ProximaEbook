  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">O</span><span class="calibre6">n the morning of March 1st, 1995, 8 astronauts and cosmonauts filed into NASA headquarters, ready to make history. Their arrival would coincide with a press conference, announcing the crew of the first human landing mission to Mars, Olympus 3, as well as the expected mission operations, timeframe, and details of their landing site. The weather was dismal, cold and raining, typical of Washington in Springtime, but in HQ, the mood was jovial. More reporters had gathered in NASA’s headquarters than ever, so many in fact that the lobby would have to be used for the conference. At 10:30am, the presenters gave their remarks, and the crew would walk out one by one in their blue flight suits, each adorned with the dusty red Olympus 3 patch. First out was NASA astronaut Commander Anna M. Douglass, the MTV pilot of Olympus 1. In her time since the first mission, she had been training in both Houston and in Moscow, and had been informed of her commanding position year prior to selection. Next out was British ESA astronaut Thomas Douglas Smith, the MTV pilot. He had worked closely with Commander Douglass during training, leaving his previous position as British Airways' youngest Concorde pilot to fly with the European astronaut class in the mid 80s. Next was Dr. George Shoemaker, the mission’s surgeon. Selected from NASA’s astronaut corps to help train other astronauts on medical procedures in space, his work had been in the minds of NASA physicians since the early 80s. Next, Mission Specialist 1, was German born ESA astronaut Sylvia Koch, whose work had helped pioneer strategies for in space orbital maintenance. Next, Laurent St. Michel of Canada, an Olympus 2 veteran and one of CSA’s most experienced astronauts. St. Michel would act as the MSAV pilot for the Martian sortie. Ivan Maksimov of Russian and Thomas Bromley of Australia would accompany Douglass and St. Michel in the lander to Elysium Planitia. They’d be supported in orbit by Yume Ueno, a rookie, but she had acted as NASDA’s lead CAPCOM for the past two years of Odyssey operations. They were a unique, diverse, and quirky crew, their chemistry and camaraderie was palpable at every press event. They were truly human, representative of the diversity of the human experience, and would be the first to set foot on another planet.<br>
<br>
The reception across the world was tremendous. No longer, in the minds of some, was this project simply America’s pipe dream, but a collaborative effort with real, demonstrable results. Astronauts from all over the world would walk together, making this a truly human exploration. Commander Douglass, in particular, had become something of a celebrity even before her mission even began. The first woman, and the first Black woman to command an Olympus mission, would make her name known in households around the world. Not even 30 years prior, the dream of the Olympus program would be seen as something so far fetched, so out there, and yet now, it was their reality: humanity's reality. As part of their preparation, an extensive media tour was planned, spending time in each of the Olympus partner nations before furthering their journey. In Australia, the astronauts would meet with members of Parliament, and take part in deep sky observations in the Outback. In Japan, the crew would visit a shrine dedicated to Amaterasu, the goddess of the Sun. This media tour mirrored that of the Apollo 11 astronauts after their historic mission, spending time in nations that contained beauty beyond their wildest dreams. In their 2 month media tour, they spent time in 56 countries, and spoke to thousands about the future of human spaceflight. The world was watching now, and it was up to these 8 souls to paint the program in a way that represented the best they had to offer. For the crew members, the media tour would be some of their fondest memories It was, in a way, their last exposure to the world before the crew would return to Houston for the final year of their training, a grueling campaign that would ensure their readiness for the groundwork of Olympus 3.<br>
<br>
The return to Houston in late May gave the crew of Olympus 3 some time to relax, but the stresses of prelaunch prep would only be heightened once again by the arrival of the Mars Base Station. After a nearly 8 month cruise, the great craft would enter the Mars sphere of influence, no longer coasting through space, but falling towards the Red Planet. The myriad of electronic eyes onboard the spacecraft would look at their target, hanging in the inky void of space, and begin to work through calculations about the projected arrival burn. The maneuver would see the spacecraft autonomously ignite its nuclear engines, and execute a long burn as the vehicle maneuvered around the night side of the planet, identical to the mission profile of the upcoming MTV. It would be here that the drop tanks, one on each side of the vehicle, would be jettisoned, after consuming what fuel remained in them. Then, with the help of the onboard orbital maneuvering system, the vehicle would settle into the orbit required for operations at Mars, inclined at about 30º. The Olympus 3 crew would be present in Mission Control, as Mission Specialist Yume Ueno sat next to the flight director, monitoring the progress of the vehicle. NASA audio was relayed to the world, as the countdown clock for orbital insertion ticked lower and lower: “<i>At this time, we are at T-minus 1 minute and 30 seconds from engine ignition. With the light speed delay, the autonomous functions of the Mars Base Station have already commanded the engines to ignite, and we will know whether or not the burn was successful after gathering data from our international fleet of relay orbiters.”</i> The timer hit 0, and the stream of data poured in. All 3 engines were running, their core temperatures stable, and vibrational loading on the vehicle remained steady. The drop tanks of the vehicle were soon jettisoned, noted by a tone sent from the vehicle and a jolt in the accelerometer. The speed of the vehicle was falling, and soon, the spacecraft slipped behind the limb of the planet, and the control center went silent.<i> “A temporary loss of carrier, to be expected as the spacecraft travels behind the planet, we expect to regain signal shortly after we lock onto the Zreniye relay.”</i> Minutes felt like hours, and the crew of Olympus 3 looked nervously around the room, crossing fingers and toes in the hopes that their home away from home would make it. Soon, a piercing tone would ring through the speakers, the MTV transmitted its health data back to Earth; a clean capture burn, and nominal performance by the nuclear engines.  All that was left was the adjustment of the orbit by the Orbital Maneuvering Engines. The room erupted, thunderous applause spilling out of the room, and somewhere, someone lit a cigar. It had been done, humanity’s first piece of infrastructure now sat around the red planet, waiting for the arrival of the crew.</span></p>

This excitement would once again be replaced with anxiety days later as the Logistics Lander, <i>Marie Curie</i>, would head for its landing site at Elysium Planitia. The vehicle carried 1820 kg of supplies, equipment, and experiments in sealed containers, as well as a beacon to help guide the crew of Olympus 3 to their landing site. The vehicle, in the last hours of free flight, would cast off its cruise stage and orient the heat shield towards the surface in preparation for landing. It would utilize its unique shape to its advantage, steering itself through entry with a combination of speed brakes and reaction control thrusters. Unlike the Base Station, they would not have continuous coverage from the relay orbiters, as the spacecraft would lose contact with Earth through the ionizing plasma. The timer to entry ticked lower and lower, only raising tensions in mission control once more. Soon, the zero hour arrived, and the lander’s ever so steady carrier tone blipped out of existence. As was the case with the base station, all the folks in mission control could do was wait, and hope that the programming instilled in this intrepid little vehicle would carry it down safely to the planet’s surface. 8 minutes felt like hours, as the information from the lander, delayed only by the speed of light, crossed the cosmos to eager eyes on Earth. Soon, their anxiety would be alleviated, as a healthy tone from <i>Marie Curie</i> broke the silence. Her navigational cameras would send back the first images from Elysium Planitia of a dusty red surface, riddled with rocks of various sizes. With her equipment down safely, <i>Marie Curie</i> would weather the Red Planet’s harsh climate while she waited for Olympus 3, a stoic little vehicle waiting patiently for the crew. In Houston, the crew would take their 4 T-38s on a flight to Kennedy Space Center to spend time in the Orbiter Processing Facility, and visit the first vehicle that would carry the crew of Olympus 3 into space, <i>Intrepid</i>. The vehicle sat in the OPF, on permanent standby for Olympus missions, the insignias of Olympus missions before stamped on the flight deck window. There they would go through practice procedures to enter and exit the spacecraft, evacuate from the launch pad, and familiarize themselves with the ground crew. For many of them, it was a return to familiarity; several of the Olympus 3 crew had got their start onboard Shuttle, and <i>Intrepid</i> was a familiar site to the Olympus 1 and 2 crew members that had flown onboard her. After about a month of prep work at the Cape, the crew would fly back to Houston and prepare for their final year of training. As the day grew closer, trajectory planners would begin to assess the most accurate departure date. According to the engineers, the ideal window for departure for Olympus 3 would be the Christmas holiday.</span></p>

As the crew continued their training on the ground, one of the final pieces of the puzzle for the Martian architecture would be assembled. The third Mars Transfer Vehicle, <i>Hera</i>, would be released from her moorings at Odyssey in October of 1995. The crew onboard Odyssey would once again shelter in their Liberté vehicle, <i>Hope</i>, and observe the great vehicle as she drifted away from the great complex in orbit. Her solar arrays and radiators spread outwards, seemingly organically, as the vehicle assumed the necessary positions for flight. She would move to join the other MTVs lingering in orbit between <i>Zarya</i> and Odyssey, visible at dawn and dusk to observers on the ground. The 5 great spacecraft were the symbol of the next great step, the way forward onto Olympus. NASA, in their early forays into online engagement, created a “Spot the Fleet” website to help the public identify the 5 spacecraft visible in the night sky. The initial tasks of Odyssey as a construction hub were now complete, and the station could shift its role into a support facility. Orbital construction had been advantageous, and soon, mission plans were being drawn up to support orbital construction of deep space probes during projected down periods on the station. A new platform for Odyssey, designed to enable EVAs for construction for telescopes and space probes, was to be assembled and sent to the station by the end of 1996, assuming all went well. The pallet would be launched onboard a manifested shuttle flight, with the first payload yet to be determined. Odyssey, in its storied career, had shown that in space assembly would be a feasible option for assembling probes, and the upper stage development work for the Jupiter-OPAV system had switched largely from the all-new architecture proposed by Lockheed, and had instead focused on the Boeing-Aerojet Phaeton upper stage. This stage, with its twin RL60s, proved easy to adapt to different vehicles, and played nicely with the Jupiter-OPAV's fuel architecture. This stage, if launched in conjunction with a pre-aggregated probe, could prove massively advantageous in the exploration of the solar system. In the meantime, NASA’s grand vision for outer planets exploration would only be aided by distributing launches through Odyssey, allowing for international partners to contribute transfer stages and continue to expand humanity’s understanding of the solar system.</span></p>

For Boeing Defense, and their Pegasus program, the transition from black op to public facing had been a rather interesting one. The vehicle had flown twice since the exposé in the Los Angeles Times, performing demonstrations of operations for those who might be interested in using the system under Boeing Civil Space. While the Air Force had made a bold and perhaps short sighted move to de-orbit the ODIN base-block, two separate entities were interested in the use of the Pegasus vehicle for civilian facing purposes. This would eventually result in a compromise to allow continued use of the vehicle, in two distinct civil forms, as well as a modified approach for operations as was originally intended. The first would be Odyssey operations, in conjunction with NASA, to help resupply the station as it prepared for expansion, with additional lab space constructed by Europe projected for addition in next few years. A two person crew would fly with the Pegasus orbiter to the station, and deliver cargo on a twice yearly basis. This would be augmented by the Japanese <i>Kounotori</i> vehicle, a logistics vehicle that could assist with station re-boost and other operations, and an upcoming European logistics vehicle named ATV. The second civilian use would be the rapid deployment of communications satellites constellations in low to medium earth orbit. For companies like Intelsat, this would be a game changer: contracting a large number of flights well in advance could enable them to get a constellation up and running much faster than through launch on a conventional rocket. Satellite internet provider Iridium had been so bold as to make the first reservation for flights onboard the Pegasus system. The third, and ultimately more military focused use, would see the Pegasus vehicle service satellites directly, without the ODIN system, much more akin to the original operations of <i>Valiant</i>. It would be, for the Air Force, a chance to demonstrate some transparency to the public, and that they had potentially learned their lesson. But would it be enough, some would wonder, to ensure that fate did not strike again? </span></p>
