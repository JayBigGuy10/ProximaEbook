  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all, this week we are taking a break from our standard format to listen to some insights about the state of space travel, the world in 1987, and what it means to go forward. Those words couldn't have been delivered by a voice, in my opinion, more powerful than Carl Sagan. I want to thank my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/CasTweetsThings" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Cass</a> who inspired me to write this whole thing, based on an example quote they gave me that's been featured in this section. It really means a lot to me that I have friends who contribute to and help me think about this project as a whole. Next week we will be picking back up with Chapter 11, and looking at how the Olympus partners will be tackling the next phase of construction and planning, including picking landing sites and preparing our hardware. In the meantime, please enjoy!</span></p>
