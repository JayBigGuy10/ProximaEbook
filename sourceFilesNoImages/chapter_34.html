  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">O</span><span class="calibre6">nboard Athena, expansion was the name of the game. In the station’s first year alone, two more modules had been brought up to the station, the European built Newton lab and the Endurance Node. Newton had increased the station’s solar power output dramatically with its new solar arrays, aiding both the service module and visiting ATV in providing power. The first long term crew, Athena Expedition 1, had made their voyage to the station from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in early 2010, overseeing numerous experiments involving life science, stellar observation, and in space construction. Expedition 1 would remark at the incredibly efficient layout of the station, a welcome improvement from the rather cramped and chaotic layout of <i>Zarya</i>. The early crew of the station would be limited to two Russian and one European crew member, as was the minimum operating rules for each segment of the station. Soon, however, they could look to expansion, as another laboratory was projected to launch in 2011 or 2012. The early days of the station had been busy, but there were still moments for reflection on the part of the crew. On Expedition 2, an experiment had been launched to the station to test how painting and other such creative activities were impacted by the Overview Effect. Athena would be the first space station in human history to receive a dedicated anthropology workstation onboard, which would be committed to studying the material legacy of objects in space. Cosmic Anthropology, as it had come to be known, had begun to grow as a field in recent years, with scholars from all over the world presenting their bids for the study of human impact in space. One such anthropologist, Dr. J Aisling, had been selected as the principal designer of the Athena Human Material Legacy System, a dedicated payload rack inside Newton. Her work would go on to be instrumental in later establishing a dedicated field of study for Human Spaceflight Practice. Athena would also host a number of external payloads, mounted on the outside of the Newton module. These would include gamma ray spectrometers focused on distant stars, and the Atmospheric CO2 Monitor provided by ESA, and sponsored by the UN Office of Climate Affairs. In the station’s first year of core complete operations, Athena would demonstrate the power of Europe’s ability to take action and go boldly into space, no longer a second tier space power, but a first rate organization in their own right. It was a glorious dawn, and as the first Expedition crew rotated out, it was clear that big things were looming just beyond the horizon.</span></p>

  <i>Athena - Expanded. The station had seen considerable growth in her first year of operation, and the small size enabled rapid upgrades. The Newton Lab and Endurance Node would be a welcome addition for crew living space, as well as the addition of ATV-2.</i>

But there was something undoubtedly missing from Athena, something that Europe had been pining for all this time - independent crew access. The agreement with Ukraine had allowed them to begin fast tracking work on crew rating systems and getting them ready to fly, but there were more tests that needed to be done. Zenit’s test flights had gone to plan - lofting a test payload into a nearly perfect circular orbit from the new launch complex at Korou, and the pad abort tests had gone well, the Liberté Test Article settling on the gentle waves of the Atlantic. But an in space shakedown would be necessary in order to certify Liberté, now with the acronym CFV (Crew Ferry Vehicle) for operations to Athena and beyond. Some within the European press wondered why a standard Liberté could not be used instead, surely it had the capability required to work in the difficult environment of launch. The European Space Agency press corps would exercise patience, and do their best to explain. The CFV vehicle was different from the lifeboat in its inclusion of the launch abort system in the fairing system it would launch with, and a beefed up orbital module. The design team had spent long hours working with astronauts to ensure that the vehicle that flew on the Shuttle test flight was as close to flight ready as possible. In the middle of the night on March 10, 2010, an Airbus Beluga aircraft touched down at the Shuttle Landing Facility. The aircraft had made the long trek from France, bringing with it CFV <i>Promise</i> and its orbital module - the first dedicated European crew vehicle. The payload was carefully unloaded, and the upgraded Liberté was hurried off of the runway and into the climate controlled Astrotech facility. Not too far away in the VAB sat <i>Endeavour</i>, mated to the rest of the stack, ready to be integrated with Europe’s promise of tomorrow. Free flights of the shuttle system were rare these days, between rotation flights to stations, MTVs and more, so this was somewhat of a treat for the astronaut corps - to feel like the pioneers that came in the generation of astronauts before them. Liftoff would occur a month later to much European fanfare, celebrating the penultimate step in Europe’s journey to become the fourth collective to achieve independent space flight. <i>Endeavour</i> would open her payload bay doors after a clean orbital insertion, exposing the vehicle to space for the first time, her pristine tiles reflecting light back into the cosmos. The new orbital module added considerable length, and the robotic arm moved carefully to extract the spacecraft from the cargo bay, soon positioning it with adequate clearance to begin its free flight. To the two European astronauts onboard the shuttle, it was a dream come true. The vision of European spaceflight was finally realized, and as the two spacecraft slowly began to drift apart, the sunlight would glint off of its twin solar arrays, fading into orbital sunrise, the dream of tomorrow could finally become today. <i>Promise</i> would spend two days orbiting the Earth, checking out her systems and putting the vehicle through her paces. Two orbit raising burns were conducted, followed by TDRSS connectivity tests, and ECLSS checks. At the end of the second day, the orbital maneuvering system would fire, pushing the vehicle towards landing at White Sands. She would ditch her orbital module and prepare for entry, her stubby body flaps working to keep her oriented in the right direction. A double sonic boom would break the stillness of the desert heat, and spotter aircraft would follow the little vehicle as it made its way down through the ever thickening atmosphere, deploying her parafoil, and gently touching down on the dry lakebed. As the handful of trucks and helicopters descended on the vehicle, the mood was jovial in Cologne: ESA was ready to fly.</span></p>

In space, the handoff period that occurred roughly every 26 months was set to occur yet again. The crew of Olympus 10 had made their journey home to Earth safely, leaving behind not just their worksite, but their rover, Argonaut, ready to begin its journey across the landing site. Retreating to a safe distance, Argonaut would capture the departure of the crew as their lander set sail for the complex in Martian orbit. After a recharge period of only a few days, Argonaut would begin the journey to Nilli Fossae, the targeted landing site of the Olympus 11 crew. It was a dangerous ordeal, if Argonaut could not make it to the next landing site, then the crew would be severely restricted in terms of area accessible by the crew. While backup plans did exist, they were less than ideal - keeping the crew within 25 km of their habitat at all times. Their prestaged cargo was already waiting for them, all that was left to deliver was the rover itself. The most difficult phase of the Follow the Water program, the drive, was on. <i>Minerva</i> had performed well on her journey home, and once her crew were safely on the ground, the final stretch of work for Olympus 11 could begin. The next lander, <i>Hercules</i>, had been launched successfully, and <i>Prometheus</i> stood ready to perform her mission, her third to the Red Planet. The crew, having spent their time in quarantine prelaunch would soon get their chance to say one final goodbye to their families as they boarded the two Astrovans to head to the pad, where <i>Intrepid</i> stood waiting. Their commander, NASA’s Jennifer Van Zandt, had flown recently as part of her training to Gateway, where her experience in handling robotic repair earned her a recommendation for the commander’s seat. Mikhail Dubrov, the MTV pilot from Russia, had been an Olympus 10 backup, and had been trained extensively on over 10 different types of aircraft. Lars Admunsen, the mission’s surgeon, had been a part of Doctors Without Borders for over 10 years, being deployed across the world to help address terrestrial health crises. Chet Howitzer of Canada would be the first appointed RMS specialist, representing his home country in new operating procedures installed in the aftermath of the Olympus 9 accident. Nikki Luciano from Italy would pilot their MSAV to the surface, having spent 6 months onboard Odyssey prior to her second flight onboard Olympus 11. Vadim Surdyuk of Ukraine, Benjamin Hampton and Jonas Graves of NASA would make up the rest of the crew, mission specialists with a diverse range of scientific and technical skills. Their twilight liftoff onboard <i>Intrepid</i> would be a glorious first step into the unknown that awaited them, and as <i>Prometheus</i> and <i>Hercules</i> ignited their nuclear engines, the adventure of Olympus 11 could well and truly begin.</span></p>

At the same moment that the crew of Olympus 11 was making history, a new birth was taking place. Rolling out under the floodlights to pad 39B, <i>Discovery</i> carried in her payload bay a most important parcel. In her belly, the core module of the latest MTV - <i>Selene</i>. Built using spare parts from her sisters, she was in every way their blood, a continuation of their legacy of exploration and expansion of human knowledge. In that moment, as the crew walked alongside the crawler, they would remember <i>Hera</i>, who gave her final breath to ensure that <i>Selene</i> may one day rise - so we may all rise with the winds of change. Onboard, the lessons learned from Olympus 9’s accident had been incorporated in full, a revamped flight deck and a whole suite of upgrades to ensure the safety of crews to come. After the 8 hour trip, <i>Discovery</i> stood proud atop the pad, ready to catch the waiting complex in orbit. For the first time in many years, a new MTV was to be assembled in orbit. But they would not be launching to Odyssey, the birthplace of <i>Selene’s</i> sisters - her delivery would come at Gateway; a trial by fire for the nascent station. As the plans to construct <i>Selene</i> had come into focus, it became clear that the aging Odyssey complex would not handle such a new construction well, that a smaller more nimble platform could do the job. Odyssey had switched to focus on science, and the sensitive nature of the station’s instruments could not facilitate such a feat. It would, in many ways, be a test. <i>Discovery</i> leapt off the pad in the early morning, carrying with her the vision of a most wonderful tomorrow, tucked so delicately in her payload bay. After the 8 ½ minute climb to orbit, the orbiter would open her payload bay, and begin the chase to the complex, a delicate rendezvous which would place the orbiter within arms reach of the station. Ever so slowly, they would close the gap, bringing the great winged spacecraft to port at the nose of the new station. The crew would spend the remainder of flight day 2 opening the hatch, and enjoying the new station smell, before the hard work began tomorrow. The first steps would be securing the new Canadarm to the first module of <i>Selene</i>, and extracting her ever so carefully. It was a delicate operation, <i>Selene’s</i> core module sat right up against the shuttle payload bay diameter limits, so every step had to be carefully calculated. Once free of the confines of Shuttle, she would be placed onboard the mounting PMA, specifically designed for this moment. The petals would interlock, and the spacecraft would become one. Small robotic arms would connect hoses to the pressure vessel, bringing vital life support and power to the nascent spacecraft. Two days later, the crew would enter the spacecraft for a preliminary inspection, ensuring that all was as it should be and nothing had been damaged during launch. Inside, they found a note, left by those who built her: “To whom this may concern, <i>Selene</i> is our next in line, our youngest child: care for her like you would your own, she is ready to face any challenge you may throw her way. Please give her a good first voyage, and think of those who built her every now and again. There is nothing we cannot do when we put our minds to it.” <i>Discovery</i> would back away from the young station after 9 days of intensive construction work, preparing the facility for the next wave of launches, eager to begin the next sequence of outfitting for <i>Selene</i>.<br>
<br>
On the ground, a hull sat open and partially disassembled, a relic from an uncertain age. In the aftermath of <i>Valiant</i>, there were some within NASA who quietly began work on a next generation system to ensure that there could potentially be a replacement for the iconic Space Shuttle. That program, X-33, had quietly been sidelined in the mid 2000s, as the prototype tanks had run into severe problems with their carbon composite elements. It had been, quite frankly, a boondoggle for Lockheed Martin. They had since moved on, dominating the field with their Atlas NG vehicle, launching in nearly every configuration, but kept tinkering with the vehicle. In a move that surprised nearly no one, the Air Force would once again put out a call for development, highlighting the recent advancements in rocket technology - The Reusable Booster Program. The program's goal was largely to fund and incentivize new technologies, albeit, while serving a certain number of high energy military flights before the general public could book a ride on a vehicle.  Lockheed would find themselves in a tough spot, Venturestar and the X-33 testbed were largely intended to be commercial and accessible by all, the Reusable Booster Program would initially severely limit their scope to military payloads. But... business was business, and the reusable program would generate revenue. Lockheed had decided, once again, to tackle their Venturestar program, and in the fall of 2010, Northrop-Grumman/Raytheon and Lockheed Martin were selected as the finalists for the program. They would each receive substantial financial backing, with the goal of launching a technology demonstrator by the end of 2013. Both were ambitious vehicles in their own right, Raven consisted of a new hypersonic, reusable first stage, using a newly developed engine: the RS-84. Its power was unmatched by anything that had been studied previously for its size, promising well over 4,000 kN at sea level. In normal operations, Raven would liftoff like a normal rocket, and pitch over for the correct ascent profile. This would loft the upper stage to an acceptable altitude, when the nose of the vehicle would open to eject the payload. The vehicle would then conduct a “boostback” burn with its OMS engines before landing on the Skid Strip at Kennedy Space Center. Unlike Venturestar, Raven would use an expendable upper stage, Corvus, one that would take advantage of new metallurgy giving it an ideal mass fraction. It would be powered by a new, Rocketdyne built upper stage known as xBantam, enabling payloads of up to 15 tons to Low Earth Orbit. Venturestar was altogether more ambitious, using a single stage to orbit design, all powered by hydrogen and oxygen. The vehicle, unlike Raven, would see development flights of a subscale test model to ensure that the design could handle the rigors of entry descent and landing. Venturestar would be able to place a couple tons more of payload into LEO, and potentially work with facilities to aggregate upper stages for far reaching destinations. Venturestar had been born in a troubled state, the technology required to build it was not quite ready, but those within Lockheed felt that they could meet the challenge and bring American spaceflight into the future.<br>
