  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">A</span><span class="calibre6">s 1983 rolled around, those within NASA, their partners, and the USSR felt that they were at last on the right track towards humans on the Red Planet. Progress on the initial assembly architecture for Olympus was proceeding nominally, with prospective flight manifests filling up with modules and components for the first permanent piece of space infrastructure. The first modules and propulsive stationkeeping elements of the Odyssey Orbital Laboratory were set to be completed in the summer of 1984. Their new, modular design, based on the modules planned for use in augmenting Skylab. This station was primarily aimed to assist in assembly and final checkout of components for the future MTVs, and later be expanded into an expansive complex for long term research in space. NASA made two crucial announcements this year, the first being a significant investment into ESA to support crew operations on the Odyssey Orbital Lab, with a crash program for a new crew vehicle known as Liberté. Liberté was a wingless lifting body that would be capable of landing 6 crew members in the event of an emergency, and would be rotated to and from the station by the Shuttle. This upcoming vehicle was to be manufactured by Aérospatiale, the French aerospace firm responsible for Concorde. Their second announcement was that the Soviet Union, in the spirit of cooperation, would join the project, providing the capability with their Energia vehicle to launch the Lander. The cooperation with the Soviet Union, while welcomed by the majority of the public, was intensely scrutinized by Congress. In the face of previous aggression, and in the wake of the race to the moon, those within governments could not help but remember the years of military buildup at NATO’s doorstep. Several Congressional members attempted to withhold funding if the agreement continued, but a passionate joint speech on the House floor by former astronaut Deke Slayton, as well as his comrade Alexei Leonov, about the importance of human cooperation in space, would move those who had their doubts to support the monumental program:<br/>
<br/>
<i>“Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve come before you today with not only a member of the Soviet space program, but with a friend. My comrade, Alexei, and I took part in one of the first international space missions 8 years ago, the Apollo Soyuz Test Project, and today on the Congressional floor, we stand ready to commit the money, time and effort towards the next great leap. Now, all those years ago, I did something fairly daring myself. My crew and I, in our spacecraft, rendezvoused with a crew from an adversarial country, who had been in conflict over ideals with us for decades, and we docked with them. Now, when we opened that hatch, I had never been more excited to see a smiling face. Alexei and I worked together to accomplish scientific goals, expand our horizons, and during that time I think we truly recognized each other as equal players in space. Now, in the face of this lofty goal to get to Mars, is it not the best move to have an equal player on our team? We cannot, and will not, go further if we go alone, isolated in a vast ocean of space. We must join hands in space, as Alexei and I did, and accomplish these goals. Today, I stand before you, not as a man trained to combat an enemy a world away, nor a man who opened the hatch for his adversary and shook his hand. I stand before you as a human being, asking you to take that giant step. Olympus must go on, and we must go, together!”</i></span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
The reception to the speech, across the country and around the world was staggering. The image of Slayton and Leonov, embracing in orbit during the ASTP mission would warm the hearts of millions, once again, and become an iconic symbol of this newfound cooperation. Those in Congress who had threatened to draw and quarter the program were now on board, gunning for an international future in space. People from all nations would take to heart what the legendary astronaut said, and championed his words that would soon become a motto amongst those who worked on the program: Olympus must go on!   <br/>
<br/>
While the Odyssey Orbital Laboratory would act as the de-facto nerve center for the orbital construction and maintenance of the MTV, a Soviet companion station would orbit ahead of the whole complex, known as the Functional Training Complex. This element of Olympus architecture would enable experiments pertaining to human longevity in space, as well as promote unity between the Soviet Union and the International Partners. The agreement was formalized in August of this year in a second conference held in Paris, and the crew rotation schedule to both stations could begin to be formalized. This display of unity, in an age where not 20 years ago, the East and West had been locked in brutal aggression, with military and social propaganda spilling out of both sides, was seen as revolutionary. Now, in this age of detente, it would seem that this newfound cooperation in space would usher a new era of political unity and prosperity. Signups for astronaut corps across the world remained higher than ever, and NASA began once again considering positions within the corps for non scientists, opening the table up to a new, but still select group of individuals. These new categories would include; engineers, teachers, journalists, artists (who specialized in interfacing with technology), historians and writers, and would not require pre-existing flight training. For NASA, this became a logical next move, as the idea of ordinary people living and working in space became something of a background mission for the human spaceflight side of the agency.<br/>
<br/>
Rolling out to the pad at SLC-6, USAF Orbiter <i>Valiant </i>made her debut in the start of 1983, delivering a classified payload for the DoD, an National Reconnaissance Office KH-11 vehicle. While KH-11s were not new vehicles, this was the first time that a crew of astronauts had been on board to assist in its deployment. Valiant would take off in the early morning of February 21st, and soar to the south, piercing the fog and beginning humanity’s first polar spaceflight. On flight day one, the payload was successfully deployed via the Remote Manipulator System, and the crew entered a rest period. The vehicle completed two days of post deployment activities before returning to Earth, triumphantly landing at Edwards Air Force Base. <i>Valiant</i> would fly several more times this year, a testament to her upgraded turnaround time, and would debut a number of features that highlighted the Air Force’s influence over the shuttle’s design. The first series of flights, starting with OF-6, would utilize a removable module similar to the Spacelab pallet flown onboard NASA's Shuttle fleet. This module, called StarLab, would allow for Air Force experiments to be conducted in the relatively stable microgravity environment of the shuttle’s payload bay. StarLab also appeased public fears about the militarization of space, in response to a scathing critique of the program published in the <i>New York Times</i>. In some ways, StarLab also answered the questions of feasibility from the MOL program, a relic of the Gemini era but largely influential for upcoming station design. The work done here would influence future Air Force endeavors, including plans for an orbital station either in a near polar orbit.</span></p>

<i>Valiant</i>, in the latter half of this year, would deploy a new piece of technology from the West Coast; the Aft Cargo Carrier. What started as a small idea would soon grow to fill the needs of the Air Force, the idea being to stack cargo in the perfectly good space between the two SRBs and the orbiter itself would soon blossom into a nearly essential addition to the DoD’s shuttle program. The Air Force, almost overjoyed with having their own orbiter, was quick to jump on the Aft Cargo Carrier as a way to get more payload into space and get the most out of their Space Shuttle. NASA was… less convinced. While the flight rate of their orbiters had been good, it became apparent that additional mass and size that they would need would have to come from a shuttle derived vehicle, and not a modified external tank. The Olympus program, as it was shaping up, would be better served with the heavy lift and super heavy lift vehicles set to be deployed in the coming decade. NASA made the choice not to deploy the ACC, but this was simply music to the Air Force’s ears. They could monopolize the ACC production line and test more outlandish missions and payloads that would not fit in the orbiter’s payload bay. Valiant debuted this equipment on OF-07, flying with a conventional StarLab pallet in the bay, while the ACC would carry a prototype on-orbit refueling vehicle, which could dock to a special fixture on StarLab and demonstrate fluid transfer. The launch would be a rousing success, and was demonstrated as well from the East Coast launch facilities at Kennedy Space Center. NASA remained wary of the program; yes, the ACC provided benefits for outsize payloads, but presented risks when flying with crew onboard. The event of an RTLS with an ACC could have catastrophic implications if maneuvers were not perfectly executed, and could theoretically lead to the destruction of the vehicle if the tank would recontact the vehicle. They would remain watchful, supporting the USAF shuttle program where they could through TDRSS and ground stations, but ever vigilant for their own potential issues. OF-07's test of the ACC and small refuelling vehicle proceeded nominally, and soon, <i>Valiant</i> would find herself flying with an ACC as standard.</span></p>
