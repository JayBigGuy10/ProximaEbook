Descent to Elysium Planitia<br>
MSAV: “Zephyr”, MTV/CAPCOM: “Basecamp”</b></div><br><br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Basecamp, we are five by and ready for undocking, greens across the board here<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Controls green, <i>Zephyr</i> is ready, standing by for undocking procedures<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> Roger that, we have a good visual on externals and will be monitoring separation, go for undocking at your discretion.<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Affirm, 10 seconds until undocking command… hooks retracting now.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass: </b>Nice and easy, Laurent. Let’s not scratch the paint before we get on the surface.<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> Hooks locked on our end, go for push-off.<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Go for push-off - we are clear of Basecamp. Relative speed .05 meters per second. I’m gonna wait for the flight computer before I pulse the RCS anymore, let us drift.<br>
<br>
<b>Shoemaker, SURGEON:</b> I’m getting good life sign telemetry from your suits now, we’ll be able to track your vitals during descent. Everyone’s looking just fine. Cabin pressure also looking stable.<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> Deploying UHF antenna now… good deployment start. Good AOS with Basecamp.<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> Ready for pitch around maneuver at your discretion, <i>Zephyr.</i><br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Roger, Basecamp, preparing for pitch around.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Just like Odyssey ops, nice and slow. Let them get a real good look at us.<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Firing forward jets-<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> Looking real good, Zephyr, TPS looks solid, not seeing any ice or FOD. Waiting for the engine section to come into view now…<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Cabin is secure, commander. After we move into the descent orbit we have a few items to stow, but we should have the largest objects bolted.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Wonderful - CAPCOM, our cabin is secure, moving through checklist 1 for descent engine insertion prep once we’ve completed the pitch around.<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> Roger, we have a visual on the engine section now. No FOD detected so far, TPS continues to look good. Speedbrake covers look good… <i>Zephyr</i> can you confirm two way telemetry uplink looks good on your end?<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Roger Basecamp, we have stable signal and data-rate. Once we move to separate, we expect some data losses but relays will make up for line of sight loss if necessary.<br>
<br>
<b>Koch, MS:</b> That’s affirm, we have uplink from the onboard atmospheric navigation packages. We will monitor them during descent and do what we can to help navigate to the landing site.<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> Sensors are online and reading notional values. I think we’re nearly ready, sensor wise at least.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> C'mon, Maks, have some confidence! We've only come how many million miles? Basecamp, we are ready for descent orbit insertion, can you verify?<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> That’s affirm. I think we’re ready to have you begin moving to the descent orbit. <i>Zephyr</i> crew, are you ready to proceed?<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Affirm, Basecamp.<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Affirm, Basecamp.<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Affirm, Basecamp.<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> Affirm, Basecamp...  <i>Zephyr</i> is ready.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center"><b>11:50 AM Local Landing Site Time<br>
Descent Orbit, MSAV "Zephyr"</b>&ZeroWidthSpace;</div><br>
<b>St. Michel</b>: Alright, we are ready for initialization of powered descent, Maks, how are our systems looking?<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> Greens across the board, with one slight issue. Slightly sticky redundant RCS jet. I’d suggest a quick pulse of the whole system.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Get on that, we’re coming up on the landing burn - Basecamp, how far are we from the go/no go point - How’s our connection to the relay network?<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> Coming up on the go/no go for landing attempt 1 in just a moment, standby.<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> We are connected currently to Zreniye-3, will hand off between MRI to Zreniye-2 during our projected entry time.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Basecamp, we are online and transmitting, awaiting telemetry check on your end for entry.<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> We’ve just got uplink from Mission Control, Earth, we are go, repeat, go, for you guys to commit to the landing. Move to section 3-1 of your checklists, and finish up securing the cabin. We have healthy telemetry from <i>Zephyr</i>, surgeon is receiving health data from all four of you.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Roger that, basecamp. Moving to section 3-1, cabin securing in progress.<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> Good readback, Zephyr.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Let’s get everything secure and switch to descent guidance, we have powered descent at our discretion…  as your commander, I am asking you now, are you willing to commit to this landing gentlemen?<br>
<br>
<b>St Michel:</b> I’m with you commander, let’s set her down.<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> I concur.<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Anna, what do you think I’m going to say? Of course. We’ve come this far.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Basecamp, we have crew confirmation, we are set to descend… Starting our countdown clock for powered landing operations, flight computer is configured at this time.<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> Roger that <i>Zephyr</i>, you are clear to proceed with powered descent.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Basecamp, get ready for Descent Burn 1.<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> Roger that Anna, you’re on the money for DB1. I will provide a countdown along with the flight computer… 10, 9, 8, 7, 6… go for engine ullage, 4, 3, 2, 1 - Ignition.<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Feel that mother go!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> We have a good light for DB1! Flight computer shows us right on the centerline… How we looking, Laurent?<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Greens across the board, we are on a nominal trajectory, engine performance looks good.<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> We have shutdown, preparing for coast…<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> We have good shutdown, <i>Zephyr</i>.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center"><b>12:05 PM Local Landing Site Time<br>
Descent, MSAV "Zephyr"</b>&ZeroWidthSpace;</div><br>
<b>Shoemaker, SURGEON</b>: I’m seeing some elevated heart rates guys, remember your breathing techniques.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Copy that, we’re a little bit excited down here… Looking at Abort Mode 1A…<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Roger that, Abort 1A. Coming up on atmospheric entry interface in about 2 minutes guys, cabin locked down?<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> Roger that, we are all bolted in, ready for entry interface.<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> 90 seconds until atmospheric entry interface<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Pyrotechnics armed?<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Copy that commander, we are set for EDL procedure.<br>
<br>
U<b>eno, CAPCOM: </b>Zephyr, Basecamp, we have you 70 seconds out from atmospheric entry. Got a good visual of you on scopes.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Copy that basecamp, expect acquisition of signal once we clear the initial ionization.<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> Have fun down there, Zephyr, we’ll be watching you.<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Entry interface in 45 seconds. Let’s start to look for landing guidance from Marie Curie…<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> I have AOS on Marie Curie!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> 30 seconds, pyros on ballute and air brakes armed. We have green lights on the board.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> This is it gentlemen, let’s hang tight.<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> 15 seconds… 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1… Entry interface, we are hitting atmosphere.<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> I’m picking up some vibration, nothing outside expected parameters… plasma buildup starting…<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> I think… there! I have a visual on the landing site on scopes, we are on target!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Here come the G’s… prepping for entry burn, good light!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> We have good burn from all 5 descent engines, moving through the worst of the heating now…<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Zephyr is responding well, commander!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Okay, engine shutdown in 10 seconds - shut down, and- hey we’ve got a caution light!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Okay, checklists people! What are we looking at?<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov: </b>Guidance fault, we can’t keep a lock on <i>Marie Curie</i>… is it the ionization? It doesn’t appear to be from plasma..<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> We need that lock re-established so Laurent can put us down in the correct spot, Bromley, you and Maksimov need to work through options.<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> 2g! 30 seconds until the ballute deploys, I need that nav system back!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley: </b>Working on it!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Maks, we need to start considering abort options if we can’t navigate to the launch site, we’re still early in the descent profile.<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> Commander, we have the manual option for landing-<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> It’s too risky, I don’t wanna risk the ship coming down in an uncharted area-<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> 20 seconds to ballute deployment, Bromley! Coming up on 2.5g!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Almost got it!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Bromley!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Lock established! You are go for ballute deploy!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Jesus, feel her go - Prime the airbrakes!<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> Airbrakes primed!<br>
 <br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Shutdown, airbrakes out! Jeez its getting hard to breathe, I can feel the weight of the planet…<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Let’s look alive, boys! Deceleration is nominal, ballute pyros are primed! Deployment on my mark! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1… Mark! Ballute out!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Shit! Spiked at 10g!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Good thing they gave us these crashpads, right? Abort mode 1C!<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> Commander, I have visual on the landing site! Guidance computer is showing us on a nominal trajectory- vibrations look nominal!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Nominal is a good word for fucking intense, we’ve been in microgravity for so long… Alright, let’s get ready for pathfinding!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Zephyr is looking at the ground for landmarks!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Systems primed for ballute cut!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Coming up in 20 seconds, looking to align with engine burn!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Preparing for powered descent! Prep for ullage on my mark, 3, 2, 1… Mark! Ignition!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Good light! 3 engines burning!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Shit, we’ve got another caution light- Maks, how we looking on guidance?<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> Commander, we are out of lock again with <i>Marie Curie</i>, we’re flying on instruments. Current estimates put us down a half kilometer from the lander, its further than we planned but-<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Jesus, our dipole antenna has been ripped clean off! We won't be able to use the landing beacon!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> So much for <i>Marie Curie</i>...<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Ok, we still have comms with Basecamp via the UHF antenna... Can we continue the descent? Laurent?<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> I can put us down. Maks, I’ll need callouts of location and altitude<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Laurent, are you sure?<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> I’m sure, commander.<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Airframe is holding, ECLSS is stable, ground tracking radar is stable, everyone remember your breathing exercises?<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> As much as I can remember anything right now, Bromley!<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov: </b>Laurent, we’re 40km downrange from the landing site, 30km in altitude, we are on track if you can keep us within descent parameters-<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> I’m getting downlink telemetry from Basecamp! No audio, data only, they have us on track, even without Marie Curie!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> 120 seconds to landing, I can see our landing site!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass</b>: My god, we’re almost there…<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Getting a lot of vibration now, we’re really in the thickest part of the atmosphere, I’m struggling to keep her steady!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> We have a fault in the drive mechanism on airbrake 1C! It’s jammed! We run the risk of drifting in our descent trajectory!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Laurent, the ascent stage RCS! We can keep the vehicle on attitude!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Commander, if we fire the RCS, we run the risk of issues on ascent, we have-<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Do it!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Firing RCS!<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> We risk scorching the TPS, please be careful!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> I’ve got her, I’ve got her…<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> 90 seconds! Moving to vertical flight!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Brace yourselves for G-loading!<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> <i>Zephyr</i>, we see you on final, getting telemetry from your suits now, you’re doing just fine, keep breathing everyone, we'll work through these issues on the surface.<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Roger that basecamp! We’re dealing with a lot more atmospheric turbulence than we expected-<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley: </b>70 seconds!<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM: </b>We see you on track for your landing site- reading good engine data from the lander, ECLSS data looks nominal<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Basecamp, prepare to start uplinking data, boy have we got a fuckton for you!<br>
<br>
<b>Ueno, CAPCOM:</b> Roger that <i>Zephyr</i>, we are standing by for your uplink! Trajectory still looking nominal for touchdown.<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> 50 seconds! Coming up on outer engine shutdown!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Bracing for shutdown, get ready for some vibration-<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Good shutdown! We’re nearly down, 300 feet!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> We have a landing leg deployment alarm! Drive mechanism on three is failed!<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> Commander, drop it manually!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> 200 feet!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Come on, lock you bastard! Triggering manual drop!<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> We have a green light! Leg is locked!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> 80 feet!<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Translating, hang tight folks, I’m trying to get us into the ideal position for landing,  kicking up a lot more dust than I thought...<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley: </b>Guidance is looking good folks!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Everyone brace for landing, we have a ten foot fall after engine cut! We are primed for Abort 3A at this time!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> 40 feet!<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov:</b> My god, the dust… it's everywhere...<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> 10 feet<br>
<br>
<b>St. Michel:</b> Prepare for engine shutdown, on my mark - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, mark! Good shutdown!<br>
<br>
<b>Bromley:</b> Freefall!<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass:</b> Contact!<br>
<br>
<b>Maksimov: </b>We’re… we’re down…<br>
<br>
<b>Douglass: </b>Basecamp, this is <i>Zephyr</i>, Tango Delta is nominal... We're safe on the surface of Mars.</span></p>
