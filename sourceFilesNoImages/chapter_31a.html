  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Good morning everyone, Last week's chapter has been... certainly something. <br><br>

For this one I've wanted to write something for Olympus 9's recovery for a while, but I'm only just now getting the chance to go back to it. So with that, here's Homecoming! <a href="https://youtu.be/Ug3giQogycU">youtu.be/Ug3giQogycU</a>

  This week begins another arduous process, the investigation. I think this chapter is one that spans our longest time frame, nearly 2 whole years.  This has been one of the hardest chapters to write, for sure, as it means looking at the shortcomings of the program in the face and being honest with ourselves - a difficult thing to do sometimes. I want to give one more shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/4possumsinacoat" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Peter</a> who has been an immensely helpful sounding board for this portion of the story, and has enabled so much wonderful creative thought to flow to paper. We'll be seeing a lot more of him around, I promiseðŸ‘€.</span></p>
