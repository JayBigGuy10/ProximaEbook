  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">I have very few words for this, really, other than... Foundation is here. The very core of human settlement on the Red Planet, for the Olympus program and beyond, is here. And we have one last ride to take before the next phase of expansion and exploration takes place, <i>Hydra's</i> last ride, before the age of the Phoenix can begin in earnest. Thank you as always to <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> for his amazing patience and kindness, and for being one of the coolest people I know. Without further adieu, Foundation.</span></p>

  <i>Arriving ahead of the crew, Foundation would deploy itself into the initial operating configuration, waiting for a distant speck hovering in orbit to begin its journey.</i>

  <i>In orbit, the final MSAV to fly, Hydra, would prepare for the landing burn, the final step in a multi million mile journey, and the end of an era for an iconic spacecraft.</i>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all!<br/>Good morning everyone!, Welcome to the year 2020! I am so so excited to share this chapter with you, and dive even further into the end of our story. Even though we still have some time to go, it is hard and a little scary to start thinking about the end! As we go through the next few weeks and wrap up, I hope to be here to answer any and all questions you may have about where we'll leave off, how the universe looks at the end of our story. I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> for his hard work getting all of our images together, and giving us some incredible and iconic shots as always. Let us get on with the show!</span></p>
