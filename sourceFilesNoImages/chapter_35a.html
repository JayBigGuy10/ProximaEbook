  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi folks!, I hope you all have been having a fantastic week, and are excited to explore what we've got in store today in Chapter 36! We're really powering through it, soon enough we'll be caught up with the present day! This week, we'll once again stay a little more terrestrial as we think about our connections in space, and explore some unique geopolitics that will ultimately help us press on in space exploration. This is something that I feel gets overlooked in real life, the immense work required to keep everyone happy and cooperating, so I want to celebrate that. I of course want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a>, who has been dealing not only with finals, but COVID as well, and has been such a trooper. Anyway, let's get on with the show and dive in!</span></p>
