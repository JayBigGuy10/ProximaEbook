  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all!, Today, we're gonna be looking in detail at the 3 missions we conducted, and taking a further look at what's coming up. A lot of my inspiration for this accident came from a timeline I read several years ago dealing with landing a shuttle orbiter autonomously, and what that might look like. Again, I'd really like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/LM__Steve" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Steven</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/salyutseven" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ben</a> who have been absolute legends in getting amazing imagery out there for us, and I am so grateful to have them on my team for this project. One thing I love about Proxima is that it's a story that shows what's going on not only in text but in images, and I think that works out really nicely for us. Now, let's take a look at what we have in store!</span></p>

  <i>Shenzhou 5 would be a dramatic achievement for China, showing to the world that they were just as capable a space power as those that came before them. Their next steps would showcase their tremendous speed with which they would proceed through the goalposts of human spaceflight.

  <i>One notable feature of Shenzhou 5 was the deployment of a small camera from the ship, enabling images of the craft to be broadcast to the world. Such a feat would soon become common for the Chinese Space Program, and result in tremendous images unmatched by other agencies.

  <i>Now in her descent orbit, the crew, commanded by the UK's Sharon Kensworth, can prepare for what's coming at Amazonis Planitia, one of the great plains of Mars. All that stands between them and the surface is 7 minutes of terror.

  <i>Despite a myriad of communication issues, Draco would touch down successfully, bringing the next four humans to walk on the Red Planet. Their stay would see a multitude of scientific experiments conducted in support of the program's goal of discovering the past life of Mars.

  <i>With her sortie on the planet completed, the last Short Stay crew would take off, and return to their other four crew members waiting on the Base Station in orbit. The next human crew to walk on Mars would do so for well over an Earth year, and push the boundaries of human exploration.</i>

  <i>As the investigation around Perseverance continued, it became clear that the damage to the vehicle could have been much worse, potentially not allowing it to survive re-entry. This image taken from a WB-57 showcases the extent of the damage to the pod as it maneuvered its way through the atmosphere, awaiting its fate in the desert.</i>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi everyone!, I hope you've all had a pleasant week, and are looking forward to our next chapter. This week, things are getting interesting, as we cycle out Mars crews, and are reminded of the sheer power of the Solar System - Something that perhaps our crews have taken for granted so far. I have a lot of people to thank today, all familiar faces who I'm super excited to have on this project - <a href="https://twitter.com/salyutseven" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ben</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lrrrrofop8" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Tracker</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PZerg5" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Zarbon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a>, who have all provided really incredible content for us today. The trend of footnotes will continue, and I'll make sure to keep doing that in the future as we go forward.</span></p>
