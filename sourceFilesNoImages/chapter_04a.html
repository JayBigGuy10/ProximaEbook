  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all,<br>
I just wanted to throw a few images up that didn't make the final posting for Chapter 4. I'm glad y'all seem to like <i>Valiant</i> so far, there is so much more in store for her and I can't wait to show you. The image I have of <i>Valiant</i> on the pad is done once again by <a href="https://twitter.com/lrrrrofop8" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Tracker</a>, and due to some limitations of parts for Vandenberg Air Force Base, is a close replica. Also included will be the official patch for the 77th Valiant Operations wing, our fictional branch which would operate the USAF orbiter, which was also very painstakingly made by Tracker for Proxima. I also wanted to share a note on <i>Valiant's</i> construction. In this case, a lot of the orbiter would have been parted out during the initial recovery for the accident to help accelerate other orbiters, but what was left that was usable would have been brought back into the assembly process. This kind of ends up with a weird ship of Theseus moment that results in OV-102 (kinda) becoming SV-001 over the course of reconstruction. Next Monday we will be diving into some international politics, and contract awards which will help advance our mission to Mars even further and I'm very excited to share that with you. Enjoy! </span></p>

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all,<br>
Welcome back! I hope you had a pleasant week. This week, we're getting into some of the technical <i>guts</i> of Olympus, and really expanding on what the technical components of this architecture, as well as expanding to our final member of the consortium that will help take humans to Mars. Keep in mind, I am no political scientist, but I thought this would represent a stable cooperative effort to help get the mission accomplished. I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/undeadfake" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Max</a> for being such a trooper with all of the iterative designs we went through, and getting these amazing illustrations out for you all to appreciate. Next week will be our last post before the holiday season where I may take some time off to get some stuff ready for y'all, as well as spending time with my family and friends.</span></p>
