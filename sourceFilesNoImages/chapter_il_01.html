“Humanity is a species, perhaps like many others, that started its life walking on the shores of beaches, traipsing through jungles, and climbing the highest mountains to see what is there. Perhaps like so many other species, humanity has wandered its home planet, our Mother Earth, and explored the wonders it has to offer. Now, we stand on the edge of our world, having surveyed what we can so far as we look into the chasm of the future - unsure of what it will bring. Will it bring destruction as we move to gain resources and power? Or will we unite, in a greater understanding as the cosmos stretches forth its hand? The latter is certainly what I’d like to believe. As we stand on this cliff, the cosmos is nearly in reach, and we have the tools to reach it. Those tools sit in factories and assembly facilities, on Earth and in Space, hurtling towards our next goal - Mars. Our great ships, like those that crossed the oceans, are about to set sail. As we reflect on these turbulent years, I think of why we might want to go to this hostile world, this place that is seemingly devoid of life and eludes our best minds, and presents more questions than answers. Perhaps we wish to one up our opponent, to use technological progress as a means of measuring success? Perhaps we are driven by some urge to take what is not yet ours so that no one may have it, as we’ve seen with resources on Earth. Perhaps it is a battleground, with wars waiting to be fought.  We, however, have seemed to escape this mutually assured destruction.<br>
<br>
Now, we are on a path to cross this great chasm of the universe, the next stepping stone of human exploration. We, as enemies, went to the moon and conquered our world, but on Mars, there can be a new start. A genesis of peace, for all the children across the world to look at and aspire to. But that is only one reason, out of infinite reasons. Maybe we’re on Mars because of the magnificent science that can be done there — the gates of the wonder world are opening in our time. Maybe we’re on Mars because we have to be, because there’s a deep nomadic impulse built into us by the evolutionary process — we come, after all, from hunter-gatherers, and for 99.9% of our tenure on Earth we’ve been wanderers. Perhaps now it is our time to wander into the stars, to stumble like a newborn, into the awesome void. We as a whole, must also look inwards, and reflect on what has come before us, and the events that will shape our journey. Tragedies, like the loss of <i>Valiant</i> this past year, are a reminder that we are not immortal, and the pull towards the stars has not left us without cuts and bruises. We must mourn, yet our mourning must remind us of what we can do in the honor of those we lost. To those that have given their lives in the pursuit of the unknown, we thank you, and will carry your legacy with us as we proceed forward into the cosmos. And to those who will go forward, on Olympus, they carry with them the knowledge that they too may slip the bonds of this world, and go forever into the inky void of space - never to return to their homeworld. We must hold them in our hearts, as they are the best of us; representing those of all races and creeds, from nations across the globe. I can’t help but think of them every time I close my eyes. <br>
<br>
The exploration of the stars is often met with criticism; why should we as a species spend so much time focused away from home? We cannot feed everyone on Earth, so why should we spend the money to send humans elsewhere? Perhaps it is a strange answer, but seeing the world you know shrink away does something to the human mind that no other perspective does. Seeing your home as an object which you can cover with a finger, hanging in an inky void, makes us want to do more to protect our place of origin. We may find the answers to caring for all of us out there in space, and bring those lessons home to help preserve the cradle of our species. Perhaps, in a way, it is our true nature to want to explore the cosmos, after all - we are born from wanderers. Someday, maybe, there will be a distant descendant of humanity moving from planet to planet, reflecting on our time we spend bound to the cradle. Perhaps it will be us, or perhaps it will be some other species who has discovered what it is left of us. Space exploration has always challenged the prospect of unthinkable vastness, bringing humankind to meet hand to hand with the furthest reaches of possibility. So too does this new endeavor we undertake bring us closer than ever to the open arms of the infinite horizon, allowing us to become not mere distant observers of this cosmos, but grow nearer than ever before, and indeed, find our place as a part of it."</span></p>
