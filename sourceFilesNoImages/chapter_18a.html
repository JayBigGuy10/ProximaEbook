  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all!, Time for some amazing images provided by our amazing artists, who I'm so grateful to feature in this week's chapter! Once again I'd like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PZerg5" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Zarbon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/salyutseven" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ben</a> for doing these fantastic pieces of work, and helping to illustrate the universe of Proxima as a whole. Today, we'll be looking at images of the first arrival operations at Mars, with the uncrewed base station doing its capture burn as we prepare for the eventual crew arrival (as well as some bonus goodies that I've thrown in here). As I've thought about this architecture more and more, the more that something like this (with a good amount of pre-staging) makes sense. It gives me hope that the lessons learned during Lunar operations with Artemis will give us a good shot at getting to Mars successfully and sustainably.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">Hi all!, Holy shit... this is it. We're going. We're really going. This week, we'll be watching as our good ship <i>Minerva</i> brings the crew of Olympus 3 into the unknown. I have a BUNCH of people I want to thank this week, including the fabulous <a href="https://twitter.com/lavie154" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Lavie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PZerg5" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Zarbon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Jay</a>, and all those who've been so supportive in getting me to this point. As much as we've looked forward to this moment, there's so much more to come. I've been reflecting throughout these weeks on the whole of the project, it's been more than a year in the making now and I'm really so lucky to get to do this. I also wanted to take this moment to talk about my next project, which is coming after Proxima wraps up later this year. It will be a continuation of some of the stories we've seen here in Proxima, with much more to explore. We've got a whole universe in front of us, and I'm so excited to share it with you all.<br>

PS: the name of this chapter is a reference to a song lyric, if you get it you get bonus points</span></p>
