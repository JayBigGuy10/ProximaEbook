  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">E</span><span class="calibre6">urope, for a long time, had been attempting to find a solution to a problem. Satellites, particularly on the commercial side, were getting smaller. Commercial launch providers, in the face of a growing environmental movement, were also eager to retire their environmentally caustic hypergolic rockets in favor of hydrolox, and in some cases, kerolox. Renewed cooperation with the Soviet Union had opened many channels, particularly for Europe in getting their hands on engine technology that had been only discussed in rumors. The NK-33 was one such engine, and with the relative disaster of the N1-L3 lunar program, the Soviet Union was eager to pump money into their space program by getting these engines onto other commercial launch vehicles. Arianespace, the commercial launch arm of ESA, was one such customer, and planned to demo the NK-33 on a new vehicle to be launched out of Korou. Reflecting on its Slavic heritage, this new vehicle would be named Strzyga, and its first stage would consist of a single NK-33 and four Ariane IV solids, with a new hydrolox upper stage powered by an HM7. This vehicle would also be useful in testing components eventually destined for Arianespace's new flagship vehicle, Ariane V, which was slated for a 1997 launch of a laboratory module to Odyssey. The first Strzyga launch vehicle rolled out to the pad in April 1991, for a test flight with a mass simulator. The vehicle lifted off of the pad nominally, pitched over, and began an ascent into the clear midday sun of French Guiana… for a short while. The vehicle, while passing through Max-Q, began to deviate from the planned trajectory, and flipped, causing the vehicle to break up dramatically, raining debris over the Atlantic. Later investigation would show numerous software failures, and the second vehicle would soon see success on reaching orbit.<br/>

Onboard Odyssey, most of the outfitting work externally on MTV-1 <i>Minerva</i> was nearing completion, with electrical lines and comms arrays being installed on the truss structure that supported the tanks, as well as external experiments supplied by universities for work in deep space and Mars orbit. This public engagement only furthered the excitement around the mission, as a wider range of institutions were invited to participate in the investigation of Mars than had been during the Apollo era's lunar sorties. Most shuttle flights, when not rotating crews or bringing Multi Purpose Logistics Modules with food and other supplies, brought components for the MTV, now visible to the naked eye from the ground, at the right time of day.  <i>Minerva</i> loomed large over the station, and for the first time, Odyssey felt like a true shipyard. The ship itself was something out of legend, a vehicle truly designed to explore other worlds, and to some; it felt a lot like the first steps towards a Star Trek future. Crews who had worked on the station during this construction phase even went on to guest star on later seasons of the show, continuing humanity’s dream to boldly go. Space Shuttle <i>Endeavour</i>, on a supply rotation, in mid Spring, brought with it a pair of IMAX cameras, aimed at exploring both life on a space station, and to capture the excitement and buildup towards the Mars mission. In July of 1991, Space Shuttle <i>Challenger</i> would launch with a very special astronaut onboard, sitting in seat seven on the middeck. Carl Sagan, in collaboration with the Olympus partners and PBS, would fly to the station complex to film a very special episode of <i>Cosmos, A Continuing Voyage</i>. During <i>Challenger’s</i> stay, Sagan would film in the orbiter, station and onboard <i>Minerva</i>, detailing to the public the intricacies of life in orbit, and the complexities of the upcoming voyage to the Red Planet. To the astronauts who flew with him, they had never met a more natural astronaut. He instantly became familiar with the mechanics of maneuvering oneself in microgravity, and spent most of his time off camera staring out the windows of the complex. Sagan would return to Earth with <i>Challenger</i>, filming the steps the crew carefully took for reentry, and when asked about his journey into space he had one thing to say: “Remarkable, simply remarkable.”</span></p>

In both Japan and California, the next crucial element of the program was taking shape, the Mars Surface Access Vehicle. Early planning work had struggled to come to an agreement about the fuel type, and feasibility of the project as a whole, but the final hydrolox design quickly came together, and took advantage of lessons learned in recent spaceflight, as well as heritage hardware that could be adapted for the task of landing humans on mars, such as the LE-57M. The lander would use a deep cooled cryogenic system, as would the rest of the system, mitigating the need for any kind of refueling operation in deep space which was seen as too high risk for a mission of this caliber. However, this presented an undesirable drawback, fueling in LEO in conjunction with fueling of its transfer stage, would be required to send the vehicle to Mars. This was a relatively costly approach, but it also allowed for the greatest amount of checkout in LEO, before the mission would leave Earth early in the Mars Departure window. In the Burbank plant, there sat 3 shells, each of them destined for space. Two of these would eventually go on to land on Mars, while the first would play an interesting role in a checkout of the system architecture. This near complete lander would serve a similar function to both Apollo 5 and Apollo 9, allowing for a systems test of the lander’s major elements on its own, life support, orbital propulsion, main propulsion, etc, without the need to land on a planetary body, as was discussed during initial planning of the MSAV test campaign. Both Lander 1 and Lander “0.5” as it came to be known would progress through construction at a similar pace, with Lander 2 following not far behind. Crucial to the lander’s success was intricate piping and electrical work which allowed for the fueling of the vehicle in orbit by dedicated, Jupiter-OPAV launched tankers. Two would be required to fuel the entire lander system, and another 6 flights would be required to fuel the transfer element, a derivative of MTV technology to send the lander on its way to Mars. Once there, the kickstage would assist the lander in the capture maneuver, and begin a series of aerobrake passes to lower the whole vehicle into Low Mars Orbit. In conjunction with the fleet of satellites around Mars, the lander would begin to search its landing ellipse for the best possible site and conditions, ahead of the crew arriving. This autonomous flight mode was known as “Pathfinding” and would allow for the flight computer to do most of the work of the crew, in conjunction with the positioning beacon onboard the Cargo Descent System lander that would arrive well ahead of the crew. Lander 0.5, upon most of its systems required for the orbital test campaign being completed, would be shipped to Baikonur early to serve another purpose, allowing crews to start to familiarize themselves with the vehicle before its debut on Olympus 2.<br/>
<br/>
While no landing crew had been announced yet for the first projected Martian landing, there was some speculation that legacy Apollo astronauts would be training these Mars bound crew members, and some groups of savvy spotters observed crews of NASA astronauts in Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, training in both plain clothes and suited. This would be the debut of xARES, the experimental version of the Advanced Recon and Exploration Suit, designed by the manufacturers of the Shuttle’s EMU. This suit combined the self-contained spaceship design from the EMU with enhanced mobility and a new, innovative mechanism for mitigating dust in the lander: the suitport. Inspired by Russian suit design for their attempted lunar program, the suitport enabled the wearer to plug their suit into a specialized door, minimizing the amount of dust tracked into the cabin. Results from the fleet at Mars had shown that the soil of the planet contained toxic perchlorates, something which could severely impact the health of the crew in the long term. Electrostatic vacuums were also in development to help astronauts scrub dust from their suits before plugging into their respective ports. Specialized sample airlocks would allow for transfer of dirt and rocks into the lander for stowage and subsequent analysis onboard the MTV and back on Earth.<br/>
<br/>
At the Cape, a series of shuttle and Jupiter-OPAV launches were planned for a critical component of the Martian architecture, the Mars Base Station. Similar in design to the MTV, the MBS would consist of a multi launch mission campaign, the first segment consisting of the Valkyrie nuclear engine used to send the stage on the way to Mars, as well as a Canadian built Remote Manipulator System. OV-204 <i>Inspiration</i> would power the segment to orbit, depositing it slightly behind the Odyssey-MTV assembly complex. Many would wonder; why not assemble the Mars Base Station at Odyssey? The rationale, according to international partners, is that it would allow for more on the fly testing of MTV components, and the subsequent shuttle flights to the Mars Base Station during its outfitting campaign would identify any concerns the MTV may have in extended free flight. It also would allow for advance testing of the fueling architecture required for the crewed MTV system, even potentially before the first MTV departed Odyssey. The following four flights would also be performed by Jupiter-OPAV, carrying the identical propulsion section tanks, as well as the drop tanks. The sixth flight would be the Power Module, launched onboard an Energia stack as part of the Soviet contribution to the project. The power module consisted of a utility node, to enable connection with additional modules that would be delivered onboard Shuttle flights, an airlock, as well as a small kilopower reactor, to generate additional power when the massive solar arrays onboard the station were obscured or in orbital night. The seventh flight would be the Hab, identical in design to the one onboard <i>Minerva</i>. The Base Station, in many ways, served as a template for the MTV’s construction and independent operation, and allowed for any lessons learned to be translated to the MTV later. Space Shuttle <i>Discovery</i> would be the first to visit the station in October of 1991, bringing with it the first specialized Multi Purpose Logistics Module The launch and construction of the Mars Base Station would see Zarya, the Odyssey-MTV stack, and the MBS all in a row in their orbital train, a delicate operation that was visible to the naked eye from the ground. For many, it was inspiring, a sign that humanity was finally ready to make their next move towards Mars.</span></p>

In November of 1991, signs had been brewing that something was imminent within the Soviet Union. To those within the US State Department, it was clear that the Soviet Union would soon be no more, and that a new power would rise in its wake. This was in some ways problematic, as a US astronaut, Dr. Nicholas Bonner, was performing life science experiments onboard <i>Zarya</i>. In cooperation with the Soviet Union, <i>Zarya</i> was to be temporarily de-crewed as negotiations in Kazakhstan took place, with one small issue. The government of Kazakhstan, in a blunt statement, could not guarantee the easy passage of partner astronauts from outside of the Soviet Union. On both sides of the iron curtain, a plan was being drawn up. <i>Atlantis</i> had been in processing for an imminent flight to Odyssey, carrying supplies for MTV construction. In an urgent meeting with state department officials, it had been decided that this mission would become a first of its kind for the shuttle - a two station visit.</span></p>

Launching on December 1st, 1991, <i>Atlantis</i> would catch up with Odyssey and dock, delivering its Multi Purpose Logistics Module to the crew onboard. It was at this time that the crew of <i>Zarya</i> would use the station’s onboard thrusters to bring the two stations closer together. <i>Atlantis</i>, coming prepared for such an operation, would undock from Odyssey and make the slow trek from one station to the other, coming to port on the zenith docking adapter. Dr. Bonner, in an off the cuff remark to his Soviet colleagues on his departure, remarked: “I certainly hope you know which country you’ll arrive in!” <i>Atlantis</i> would head home safely to Florida, while the two cosmonauts would board their Soyuz capsule, and head for the steppes of a newly independent Kazakhstan. Now, in the place of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation would come into form, and with it, the promise of a new tomorrow that looked very different from the past 74 years. Thankfully, the new government would remain as confident in the Olympus program as their predecessor, and the dream of Mars remained on track.</span></p>
