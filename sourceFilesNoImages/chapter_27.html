  <i>The crew of Olympus 7, now bearing down on Mars, would face their most difficult tasks yet... landing on the Red Planet.</i>
</span></p>

he mood on <i>Hera</i> during the cruise had best been described as concerned. Every day, as the crew grew closer to Mars, the prospect of not being able to remain on the surface weighed even heavier in their mind. The new year, 2003, had brought them some joy, and they spent time celebrating onboard, but concerns remained. The idea that their supplies on Mars may not be there to support them during their stay was alarming to say the least, and weighed heavily in their Commander’s mind. Commander Diaz found himself spending time reviewing the contingency procedures, and preparing himself for how to break the news to the crew that their stay on the red planet would be cut short. Throughout the rest of the crew, the mood was tense. In the solar storm, some of the computers containing personal entertainment had been wiped. Fortunately for the crew, disks with films had been left on the Base Station for their enjoyment post arrival. Mars crept into view around the six month mark in their voyage, and soon, they could begin to prepare for their arrival on the Red Planet. <i>Scorpius</i>, the crew’s MSAV, had weathered the journey with minimal damages, a testament to the robust design that the Lockheed-Mitsubishi consortium had built into the vehicle. The days leading to orbital insertion were full of excitement, but a resonating anxiety sat in the hearts of the crew members. A failed or critically damaged module on the surface would ultimately result in an abort, and having to spend their stay in orbit, something that would ultimately be detrimental to their health. 3 days before orbital insertion, they would observe the streaks of light visible on their telescopes as the Olympus 8 equipment successfully streaked towards the landing site of their successor mission, albeit without the drama of their own endeavor. The day of orbital insertion finally came, and the crew very diligently strapped into their seats, waiting to feel the push of the engines on their backs. <i>Hera</i> pushed on diligently, ditching her drop tanks cleanly as her nuclear engines pushed her into orbit. Ever so gently, her velocity would fall, and the red-brown dust of Mars would seem to lap at their windows, like the waves of some unforgiving ocean. The crew of Olympus 7 had done it, becoming the fourth crew to orbit Mars, a moment shared quietly among the crew as the ship assumed the correct attitude for operations in Mars orbit. The mood had improved as they made their way to the Base Station, and as <i>Scorpius</i> moved ever closer to docking. But, even still, as the landing date approached, Commander Diaz would find his Mission Specialist, Mikkel Fischer, crying silently as he sat in the cupola. “Commander…” he would later recall saying, “I’m sorry. I meant to be stronger than this. I know I can do it, I know we all can, but the thought of coming this far and not touching the surface with my own hands hurts me so.” Diaz would comfort him the best he could, but in his mind, he knew that the risk was very real, and the same fear began to grow inside the commander’s mind.<br>
<br>
30 days after arriving at Mars, the crew would board their lander, and begin the process of undocking. <i>Scorpius</i> would soon back away from the great complex, and the crew could feast their eyes on the sheer magnitude of the spacecraft assembled in Martian orbit. The weather forecasts at their projected landing site had looked rocky during the first ten days of their orbital stay, but the dust had begun to settle, and the crew felt comfortable pressing onwards with the landing. Very carefully, Catarina Hammond would back the lander away, and soon, it would be nothing more than a speck hanging over the red brown horizon. Entry would be the next item on the agenda, with only one orbit left before they could commit to their descent and entry burn. Ignition of the LE-57Ms would push the crew into their entry couches and the vibrations of the engines would shake the crew. Unlike previous landings, with all of the crew on the flight deck, half of the team would be in temporary seats on the middeck, separated by a bulkhead. In some ways, it was isolating, and only added to the tension of entry. Soon, the atmosphere would start to lick at the vehicle, causing the cabin to vibrate. The sounds of the atmosphere biting at their ship soon started to increase, as the lander extended its airbrakes and fired its engines for the descent burn. Learning from the previous landings, the vehicle made finer adjustments of heading and orientation, and kept a lock on the landing beacon. Soon, the jolt of the ballute would slow the craft even further, and the RCS would begin to help orient the craft towards the landing site. The crew would soon capture the first images of their outpost, less than half a kilometer from their projected landing site and still in one piece. This brought some comfort to them as the vehicle fine tuned its landing, and switched to their single engine for the final moments of descent. The vehicle shuddered and groaned as they made their final descent, and the touch of the landing legs on the surface, the sounding of the contact tone, were of some comfort to the crew. The spool down of the systems onboard, and the mechanical switching of fans and motors a sigh of relief from their mechanical chariot. They had made it, and as the dust settled, the scope of their mission became clear. The next few days were spent in the comfort of the lander, adjusting to gravity, and prepping their spacesuits for the next task at hand, establishing their home away from home.</span></p>

  <i>MSAV Block 2 Scorpius prepares to bring the crew of Olympus 7 to the surface of Mars, the first 8 person crew to land on the planet. The upgraded lander sported a more robust upper stage, and a descent stage more attuned to wet workshop conversion</i>
</span></p>

  <br/> 

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
On Sol 7, after a week of light activity and overall confinement inside the lander, the first work on establishing their home away from home on Chryse Planitia could begin. The first step in preparing the MSAV’s descent stage for conversion would be the draining of any remaining propellant in the 7 meter habitat, and fetching the augmentation modules. Solovyova would be the technician to focus on this, and a command from the flight deck would see the vehicle dump its propellant overboard. The hydrogen and oxygen, much colder than the surrounding environment, would evaporate to steam, dissipating into the atmosphere of the planet. The next step would be the half mile traverse to the logistics modules, and inspection. One by one, the astronauts would don their ARES suits and assist the others onto the crew elevator. The group’s first steps on the Martian soil were full of excitement, and for a moment, they would forget the tension of their situation. They were walking on another planet, for God's sake. The low gravity led to a few stumbles, but soon, the crew had planted their 7 flags, and had begun to unpack the rover to inspect the logistics modules. The drive over was not filled with chatter, as the module’s condition remained uncertain. The crew of four, Diaz, Hammond, Solovyova and Foust trundled over the uneven Martian landscape, eyeing the two habs as they crested a crater. The two habs sat about 90 meters apart, atop their movable platforms. Ladders extended from them, and a seat with a joystick for control back to the lander. As the crew arrived and got to work, the extent of the impact on the logistics module became clear. The cable had indeed whipped against the vehicle, but not significantly enough to puncture the pressure vessel, and a quick check of the habitat’s systems showed that pressure was stable. The crew could breathe a sigh of relief, Diaz’s heart rate finally slowing enough that his life support systems could stop telling him to take it easy. The crew were overjoyed, and soon, Hammond and Solovyova were navigating the twin modules into position on the sides of the lander, ready to begin their integration. As part of the final test of the systems, the crew would drive the modules up to the sides and begin to erect them to the level of the descent stage. Soon, the modules would be lifted to the height of their hatches, and the covers cast into the dirt, ready for integration.<br>
<br>
Integration of the twin modules was as smooth as they could expect, and soon, the crew could work on setting up their home away from home. Using a special hatch built into the bottom of the lander, the crew could climb into the tank and doff their suits, mitigating dust issues which were an ever present threat. As the crew changed into shirtsleeves, headlamps and work gloves, it was clear that they had a lot to do. The empty, cavernous space of the fuel tank would soon be bathed in light, as the crew worked to get the hatches to the logistics modules open. With the hatches open, they could begin to install the walls, floor and radiation shielding within the habitat. It was tiring work, but the light weight components and overall ease of installation sped the process along. By the end of the first day of assembly, the 3 main floors of the habitat, and wall dividers for crew privacy had been set up, and the life support racks were moving air throughout their new home. It was, admittedly, a strange feeling to sit within a fuel tank and use it as your home away from home, but to the astronauts, they felt at peace, comforted by the walls of their own sleep stations - that itself was a benefit. Actual beds, albeit they were rolled up mattress pads and cots, but they were real beds, and as the astronauts headed to bed after their first of many days on the surface, they found themselves sleeping comfortably. The next few days saw the crew setting up equipment racks inside the logistics modules, and moving supplies from the habitat in the ascent stage of the lander. This was supplemented by a trip to their small logistics lander, <i>Cecilia Payne</i>, to collect mission specific science kits from the small spacecraft. By Sol 14, the crew could finally finish up the cosmetic outfitting of their home away from home, and remove the window covers on the end of the logistics modules, letting in natural light and letting the crew finally start to feel comfortable in their new home. The immediate science objectives for the mission would be the trek to the Tempe Terra outflow delta, and begin to look for signs of past or present life, and identify what processes drove the creation of these features. Weeks would soon turn into months, and the crews on the ground would marvel at the science return gathered. Images from the planet would showcase the great deltas and valleys carved from Martian sandstone, and the crew would spend countless hours in the lab investigating their findings, doing more in the first five months on the surface than all of the other crewed missions combined. The long stay era on Mars was here.</span></p>

On Earth, mission planners within NASA’s robotic science division were left with a challenge. The intrepid probe Galileo, orbiting the planet Jupiter for nearly a decade, was heading towards its end of life. Current plans for Jovian exploration called for a new breed of spacecraft, the Jovian Moons Explorer, or JOME to be launched in the upcoming 2011 window. Utilizing lessons learned from nuclear power in space, this probe would represent some of the latest and greatest technological advancements in space exploration. Nuclear electric propulsion would be utilized, resulting in a massive spacecraft assembled in multiple launches. In order to keep science at Jupiter going for as long as possible, the mission planners at JPL would make use of the mysterious moons of the planet to swing the probe into a new regime, a higher latitude orbit that would enable scanning of the planet and moons from a variety of angles. The probe had performed better than anyone had expected, and even in the high radiation environment of the planet, the probe continued to return images and data from the giant world. This new mission phase, called the Great Voyage, would see Galileo work to expand its knowledge in this new orbital regime. The successor, the concept formerly known as JOME, would be named Borelli, after the great astronomer who continued Galileo's work. Work on the Planetary Defense Program would begin in earnest this year, with the beginning of planning for JAVELIN: The Joint Asteroid VELocity INterceptor. A joint mission between the newly renamed JAXA and NASA, this mission would aim to slam into asteroid Didymos, which, rather conveniently, had a small moon orbiting it. The European Space Agency would also begin work on their contributions to the PDP, a monitoring probe named NEO-Hunter, a powerful, cryo cooled telescope that would scan near-earth space to investigate possible hazardous objects, as well as a mission known as the Asteroid Rendezvous-Tracking Probe. This secondary probe would aim to investigate the system visited by JAVELIN,  and better characterize the impact The program received incredible public support, as fears of impending doom loomed over the public. To many, space was a place to be explored, but also still a place of fear, an ever present threat that could just as easily eliminate life on Earth, as well as seed it elsewhere in the cosmos.</span></p>

  <i>Shenzhou 7 docks with the Tiangong-1 station in LEO, a major leap for China as a growing space power, and a shocking message for the Western world.</i>
</span></p>

  <br/> 

<p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre6">
The Gobi Desert was once again rocked by something great, a blue and white streak riding a pillar of flame, sending the beasts of this barren expanse running for safety. The seemingly deserted launch site was awash in the light from the clustered first stage, disturbing the long held peace of the sand. The vehicle streaked skywards, the second crewed launch of the Chinese Manned Space Program, Shenzhou 7. The crew consisted entirely of People’s Liberation Army Air Force veterans, but the exact complement was not yet known to Western observers. Their rocket punching through the atmosphere, shedding components as they set their sights on a target, a small, orbital laboratory loitering in orbit, Tiangong-1. The station’s launch had been detected by Western satellite intelligence days prior, and had slipped into a comfortable orbit. It was rumored that several KH-11 KENNENs had turned their optics towards this object, unsure of its purpose. Now, as Shenzhou 7 spread its wings in orbit, it became clear - this was a docking attempt at a space station, a major leap. The Shenzhou capsule would spend the following two days chasing the station, a delicate orbital balance that saw the two vehicles conduct proximity operations, and after 48 hours of chase, the APAS-like ports of the two vehicles would meet, and the Chinese press would broadcast footage of the crew inside their own fully fledged space station - a shock to Western space powers. In a televised speech, the commander of the mission Zhai Zhigang would address the world and inform them of the greater ambitions of the Chinese Space Program - To conduct the first Chinese spacewalk on this mission, and prepare for greater things in the years to come: a modular space station constructed in Low Earth Orbit, as well as a telescope that would be serviced at this new facility. The agency would also unveil a new cargo spacecraft, Tianzhou, that would be based off of the pressure vessel of their very station. This space station would be open to all those who wished to fly their astronauts or experiments onboard, and aimed to within the first year that the station was completed, to fly a UN sponsored mission. They would then follow this up with the advancement of heavy lift rockets for crewed missions to Near Earth Objects starting sometime in the late 2010s, perhaps early 2020s. It was a bold claim, a claim not matched in scale since the announcement of the Olympus program as a whole, all those years ago. But they had shown the speed and success unmatched in modern spaceflight, and cemented their place as a power to admire. </span></p>
