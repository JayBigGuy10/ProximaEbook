  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">F</span><span class="calibre6">or the first time in 9 years, a new vehicle would fly from Space Launch Complex 39. Formerly known as the Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle - Orbital Payload Assist Vehicle, the vehicle had been rechristened to the Jupiter-OPAV system, a powerful name for one of the most powerful launch vehicles ever produced. Early in April, the first Jupiter-OPAV, OV-201 <i>Adventure</i> rolled out for fit checks on the Mobile Launch Platform from the Vehicle Assembly Building, and was successfully integrated and checked out on the newly modified LC-39A tower. This pad, unlike LC-39B, had been modified to support fueling and payload support operations for Jupiter, as they could host a variety of payloads inside the 8.4m diameter fairing; as well as handle outsize cargo. This conversion work had been undertaken one pad at a time to minimize disruption to launch vehicle flow. The extension of the Fixed Service Structure to accommodate the variety of new vehicles to fly from the pad gave it a mechanical feel, with many arms extended to meet the vehicle and countless more locked away to prevent damage during launch. The pad resembled something of a hybrid between the Shuttle era and the Apollo era before it, but all together more complicated. Another key modification to the complex was the expansion of the liquid hydrogen storage facilities; both liquid and slush hydrogen. When the tankers came online in the following two years, the fuel they would bring up would be condensed into a slush to provide greater energy density for the Transfer Vehicles’ nuclear thermal engines. This necessitated new storage facilities alongside the launch complex, and new electrical lines to help power the condensers. While this pad was modified to host the Jupiter-OPAV fleet, it retained its ability to host standard shuttle operations, essential for the pace of the program.<br/>
 <br/>
Jupiter-OPAV’s first payload was a mass replica of the upcoming Mars Transfer Vehicle's inflatable habitat, as well as a small orbital maneuvering kickstage, to demonstrate technologies leveraged from the Air Force’s Orbital Maneuvering Vehicles. These kickstages would be essential, in the 8.4 meter configuration, for transferring payloads to their delivery orbit. The flight would also serve as an effectiveness test of the upgraded flight computers built for a unique orbital profile such as that of Jupiter. Four OPAVs were in the works, in order to support the flight rate of the program, <i>Adventure, Perseverance, Endurance</i> and <i>Inspiration</i>, named after the core ideals of the NASA human spaceflight office in support of the Mars program. Upgrades for Jupiter were already planned by the time the vehicle rolled out for its fit check, including a 5 meter upper stage which would be required for heavier, single shot interplanetary missions, and work on the tankers, derived from the hydrogen tanks in the ET, had already begun. The tanker, being the most important component to the overall architecture of Olympus, would enter production before the upper stage, ensuring that the MTVs could be fueled for their missions to the Red Planet. These tankers would be fairly simple in tooling, and carry over avionics from the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicles to streamline operations.</span></p>

<i>Adventure’s</i> test flight served a two fold purpose; to test the systems and upgrades carried over from the Shuttle, and to verify the flight profile of the system in real world conditions. The vehicle spent 3 weeks in April on the pad, before being rolled back to the VAB for additional inspection. Liftoff occurred at 12:21pm on May 14th, and the vehicle mimicked the Shuttle in its pitch and roll maneuvers. For many watching at the Cape, the ascent was familiar and in some ways, almost more mechanical and precise than the orbiters that had come before it. Burnout of the solid rocket motors occurred in line with Shuttle launches before it, and the vehicle performed the roll maneuver to make contact with the Tracking Data Relay Satellite System network. <i>Adventure</i> completed her orbit insertion flawlessly, executing maneuvers which differed slightly from the shuttle in that the whole external tank could be brought into orbit. This flatter trajectory prevented abort modes like on the shuttle, but enabled greater payload to orbit, not that it would be needed with no crew onboard. Once in orbit, <i>Adventure</i> separated from the external tank, and conducted the free flight portion of the mission, a one orbit fly around of Earth to prepare for recovery at White Sands. The mass simulator, covered with sensors, would remain in orbit for nearly a year and a half, hosting a variety of experiments for NASA and their partner agencies. The External Tank, its mission also completed, fired its six deorbit motors to burn up over the Pacific ocean. <i>Adventure</i>, firing her shuttle-derived OMS engines, would bring herself down into the atmosphere and use her unique lifting body profile to execute a re-entry that could be precisely controlled. The vehicle entered the atmosphere and, for the engineers working on the project, the most complex phase yet. While on the Shuttle, there would be a crew to govern the actions of the orbiter, the OPAV pods would be entirely autonomous, having to execute maneuvers to slow the vehicle down and fire its parachutes in precise sequence. Naturally, a testament to those who built it, the vehicle performed flawlessly, and remained stable throughout the entry sequence. The OPAV deployed its parafoil over the desert, and 1,000 feet off the ground, deployed its landing skids. The vehicle sat quietly in the desert as recovery crews drove through the gypsum sands, and <i>Adventure</i> would be brought back to Palmdale for intense inspection before the next series of flights. Post flight analysis revealed that the vehicle had performed even better than expected, with the only major issues observed during the final landing, as the skids’ hydraulics system did not give enough and used some of the honeycomb crush core. The test flight had been labeled a massive success, completing all of the objectives that the designers and engineers had hoped for. The idea of a fleet of reusable vehicles, not just the shuttle, was now realized - and the world’s future in space seemed even more within reach.<br/>
<br/>
It was at this time that the program hit a major problem; more cargo would be required on the Martian surface that could not be delivered in the confines of the MSAV, such as additional surface experiments, mission specific hardware as well as spare parts for both the lander and suits. The MSAV had been effective in accommodating cargo, cramming materials into every nook and cranny of the crew lander without restricting performance in the long run. While the idea of a logistics lander had been included in the mission planning, it had not been anticipated that one would end up being required for every mission. In reality, it would end up being restrictive to not include such a vehicle in mission planning. Early concepts for mission planning had considered a much larger lander, capable of putting 8-10 tons on the surface, however, a vehicle to launch it would require a massive departure stage to send it to Mars. Engineers at both JPL and Johnson were quick to identify several needs of the crew, largely site specific cargo as well as tools that would be required. Internal layouts of the lander were also coming to a close design wise, and a good range of storage space would enable maximum payload return without the need for bulky external stowage. The CDS, Cargo Descent System, would be born from the ashes of an unlikely source, the Viking lander. Engineers were quick to identify robustness in the overall design of the old landing system, and would work to develop newer, higher performance variants of the engines used to land Viking to enable up to 2.5 tons of additional cargo. Granted, while the crew lander could still handle a large amount of payload on its own, the vehicle had space within the aerodynamic shell to store cargo, which was planned from the start. However, this additional cargo allowed for redundancy with the certain key elements, and would give astronauts a much better shot if something were to go wrong on the surface.<br/>

Elsewhere in the launch market, a new class of launchers was starting to emerge. Small to medium satellites had often found themselves riding piggyback on other launchers, and the newly emergent “micro-sat” market had struggled to find rides amid the flurry of launches in support of the Olympus program and other large commercial operations. Lockheed was one of the first to truly tackle the smaller side of the commercial launch market, debuting a rather unusual system. This system would come to be known as the LLV-27 <i>Wavemaker</i>, a conversion of the UGM-27 Polaris missile system once found on US submarines. The principle modification was the addition of a Star 48 motor, which would insert the payload into its final orbit. It was not as precise as something like a Centaur or other high efficiency upper stage, but it got the job done. A benefit of the Olympus program, and the immense public support behind it, was tremendous de-escalation of arms in the Cold War, and the retirement of nuclear missiles such as Titan and Polaris. Martin Marietta had considerable success in refitting older Titan II missiles into the Titan 23G, with refits being planned to upgrade the payload capacity with new, smaller solids from the Graphite Epoxy Motor (GEM) family, and Lockheed had taken note. <i>Wavemaker</i> would be unique in its operation, as it could be launched from one of two platforms. The first platform would be a dedicated launch pad at Wallops Flight Facility, the first orbital class rocket operating out of Virginia. The relatively “rough and ready” pad lent itself well to solids and storable propellants, as the remote location did not have adequate linkages to hydrolox or kerolox production facilities. The second would be a specialized, ocean based platform towed behind a support ship, stationed out of Port Canaveral. The support ship, named <i>Trident</i>, would tow <i>Wavemaker</i> to a predetermined site and back off, with the platform’s active stabilization keeping the vehicle in an adequate position for launch. By having a mobile launch platform, the vehicle could be positioned anywhere in the world to maximize efficiency in getting payloads to orbit. <i>Wavemaker</i> would conduct its first launch out of Wallops in November, 1989, streaking skyward with a pair of Air Force testbed satellites, and inserting them into a nominal orbit. Ultimately, <i>Wavemaker</i> would go on to serve as a staple microsat launcher, and would not hold the monopoly on the small satellite launcher for long. Where the vehicle was limited was its availability; under SALT the vehicle could not fly for non-US customers. However, this did not stop the ball from rolling. The success of <i>Wavemaker</i>, and the relative crowding of the Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg would soon begin to attract more solid fueled vehicles to the Virginia facility.</span></p>
