  <p class="calibre16"><span class="calibre21">A</span><span class="calibre6">midst the activity of the Human Spaceflight Office's endeavors, NASA’s planetary science office was proceeding with bold missions to destinations across the solar system. In May of 1986, a launch from the Kennedy Space Center broke the morning silence. The <i>Galileo</i> mission, a multi year, orbital campaign at Jupiter, was carried into space by <i>Discovery</i>, and was sent on its way by the solid fueled Inertial Upper Stage. Originally planned to be launched with a Centaur, potential consequences of carrying a payload bay full of liquid hydrogen was deemed too risky, and the upper stage was switched. This vehicle would be the first of many interplanetary missions launched from the Space Shuttle. After separation from the upper stage, the probe successfully unfolded its high gain antenna, magnetometer booms and assumed the correct attitude for cruise. Thus began the multi billion mile trek to Jupiter, conducting multiple flybys to build up momentum as <i>Galileo</i> traveled throughout the Solar System.<br>

In the case for Mars, there were crucial questions that remained unanswered. How much did the weather impact the planet’s surface? What does solar wind interaction look like? Where would the best landing site for water be located, and how can we manage safety in an area that might be the most geologically interesting? In preparation for the upcoming crewed Mars missions, NASA, ESA and the Soviet Union would launch the largest ensemble of ships to the Red Planet on record.  These spacecraft would serve to rapidly expand human knowledge of the Red Planet, beyond the work done by the <i>Mariner</i> and <i>Viking</i> programs. The roles of the spacecraft were split into 3 distinct categories; high fidelity planetary imaging, surface environment categorization and communications. Most of the probes in the 1986 fleet would consist of imaging probes, the largest of which would be the joint NASA-ESA <i>Mars Dual Surface Mapper</i>. This mission would consist of two spacecraft orbiting at slightly different near polar inclinations, aimed to observe as much of the planet as possible. Work on these orbiters had begun in 1979 at JPL as part of the Planetary Exploration Program, the idea being that over a period of time, the probes could work in tandem to collect data about the planet’s surface. The primary instruments for the probes would be their high power cameras, derived from sensors developed for the Corona program. The individual probes would be named <i>Eros</i> and <i>Anteros</i>, twin investigators at Mars which would help pave the way and act as an early relay for orbiters and landers. These two spacecraft would be launched together on a Titan IIIE, and would arrive at Mars in early 1987.</span></p>

ESA would contribute another orbiter to the ensemble, the <i>Copernicus</i> climate mapping spacecraft, to help study the overall qualities of the Martian atmosphere, and help to study the ways in which various gasses played a part in the climate of the planet. The probe would be one of Europe’s first interplanetary missions, using a leftover spacecraft bus from the Giotto comet spacecraft launched the previous year. This bus would prove to be incredibly reliable, and become a staple of early European planetary exploration. The launch would see the use of an Ariane 44L, a reliable lifter in its own right. The spacecraft would differ from its cometary counterpart in several distinct ways, the first being the removal of the Whipple shielding and the installation of a non rotating science platform, as well as the change from a fixed antenna to a pointable antenna, also mounted on the science platform. Also added to the probe would be a small solid stage, meant to assist the spacecraft with orbital insertion, with fine tuning coming from the spacecraft's onboard propulsion. The probe would aim to categorize the ideal time of year for crewed Martian landings, and identify any atmospheric anomalies not detected by earlier generations of spacecraft.  </span></p>

The Soviet Union would undertake the heavy lifting of the program, launching 4 complicated spacecraft during the window. Communication at Mars was essential, as the crew would be splitting up into two teams during the initial wave of landings, the orbital team and the descent team. To ensure local communications remained solid, the Soviets looked to the success of the American Tracking and Data Relay Satellites and began to formulate their design. The result would be a series of 3 relay spacecraft, placed in an areostationary orbit around the Red Planet. These spacecraft would come to be known as <i>Zreniye</i>, Russian for eyesight. The fourth spacecraft the Soviets would launch carried with it a ground penetrating radar suite, known as <i>Vody</i>, designed to look for water near candidate landing sites. It was thought that water near a landing site could potentially harbor the ingredients for life, and in the case of a lifeless water source, assist the crew in long term exploration through the use of in situ resource utilization, or ISRU. The 3 relay orbiters would be launched on Proton launch vehicles, while <i>Vody</i> would be launched on a Zenit, the testbed vehicle for the upcoming Energia lifter. All of the spacecraft would arrive at Mars successfully, beginning Phase 1 of the Olympus Program’s precursor work.</span></p>

In space, construction was nearing its final stages on the Odyssey Orbital Laboratory.<i> Atlantis</i> would bring up the second set of robotic arms, fitted on the shorter end of the station’s truss structure, giving the station adequate reach.  With the flight of Space Shuttles <i>Discovery</i>, <i>Intrepid</i> and <i>Endeavour</i> the external payload racks and support arms for the MTV would be delivered, rendering the station complete. These were outfitted in a series of complex, multi hour spacewalks, and the first time that both the Shuttle Airlock and the Station airlock had been used in conjunction to enable four crewmembers to work outside. By splitting up the crews of spacewalkers into two distinct teams, they could accomplish much more, and reduce the overall time spent outside the vehicle. Once this outfitting was complete, Odyssey Orbital Laboratory was the largest structure ever assembled in space, and could be seen from the ground easily. However, there remained a gap in capability that needed to be solved, crew access. A major wrench had been thrown in the European led project in the fall of 1986, when the first crew rated <i>Liberté</i> Crew Return Vehicle rolled off of the production line. All had gone well during checkout, however, during shipment, the heat shield tiles of the vehicle had been damaged due to poor handling. After inspection at the Kennedy Space Center, the vehicle was returned to Toulouse for repairs. Until completion of the CRV, it had been decided that Soyuz vehicles refitted with APAS ports would temporarily fly to the station, with the partner agencies waiting to use Shuttle in conjunction with the <i>Liberté</i> CRV. In conjunction with Odyssey’s completion, a unique demonstrator was launched onboard a Titan IIIE, an inflatable module demonstration mission, designed to remain in LEO for up to a year, measuring the effectiveness of inflatable habitat design before proceeding with final assembly on the Hab segments on the ground. The vehicle would demonstrate the robustness of inflatable design, and would demonstrate passive radiation insulation, thermal management and MMOD shielding. After just 7 months in orbit, the pathfinder mission was labeled a success, and deorbited.  <br>

In the Soviet Union, a behemoth was being born. Energia, the modular launch vehicle slated for launching heavy payloads, and in another life, a space shuttle of Soviet design, was rolled out to the pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome for the first time. This would begin a three week campaign of fit checks before rolling back for payload installation. Energia's four Zenit boosters had been flight proven, their functionality and reliability had been proved in the launching of <i>Vody</i> to Mars, as well as a new series of Earth orbit tracking and relay satellites. This first payload, a DOS block core module, would be launched to a 51.6º orbit, the same orbital inclination of the Odyssey Orbital Laboratory. This first module of the Functional Training Complex <span style="font-family: 'arial'">(Функциональный тренировочный комплекс) </span>was originally planned for a much larger space station known as Mir, would be the first of 3, comprising a small space station designed to help train astronauts for long duration spaceflight. This station, first thought of years ago before the Paris Agreement, had been delayed several times due to issues with construction, but now, the plans for Mars were bearing fruit. Leaning on the design of the venerable Salyut stations, this station would incorporate lessons learned from the prolific life of the Soviet LEO effort. This DOS core block would serve as the command and control center for human training, and aim to complement the work of Odyssey. As part of the agreement, partner astronauts would fly to both the Soviet station, as well as to Odyssey for assembly assistance and training onboard the MTV. The station's launch was a resounding success, and was christened <i>Zarya</i>, the Russian word for Sunrise. </span></p>

<i>Valiant</i>, after a brief stand down in the beginning of the year, would see a rare east coast launch deploying 3 Space Test Program satellites, as well as a quick-turnaround flight from the west coast with a Starlab pallet in tow. There had been a great sense of unease emanating from NASA over the Air Force’s use of <i>Valiant</i>, and the close call during OF-16 had only made this anxiety worse. While NASA could improve safety aspects on their own vehicles, they were relatively powerless to influence the Pentagon’s operating procedure. There had been suggestions to intervene on the part of Rockwell, but pressure from Air Force leadership had kept the vehicle flying. Use of the Aft Cargo Carrier had become standard on every flight, and the Air Force had been rumored to be looking at moving all DoD flights onto <i>Valiant</i>, despite initial pushback from expendable launch vehicle manufacturers. To the Air Force, the incident of the previous year was merely a hiccup, and higher ups continued to tout <i>Valiant’s</i> high flight rate as a selling factor to Congress. Deep within the inner workings of Shuttle contractors however, there remained a great deal of concern.  According to those within the industry, mismanagement and poor handling of the vehicle, on the part of the Air Force, would only lead to further incidents like OF-16, and many within Rockwell, Martin Marietta and Thiokol felt powerless to stand up to the higher ups at the Pentagon. To those watching from the sidelines, it was a nail biter - but to those within the military, the sky was the limit.</span></p>
